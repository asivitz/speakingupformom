    <div class="chbody">
        <p>After her second hospital stay and seven more days in rehab (they didn’t even try to make her do therapy this time), we were finally taking Mom home. The temperature outside had been in single digits for weeks, so we waited for the first sunny day when the mercury rose above freezing to transport her to our house. When I told Mom about the move, she put up a fuss. She said she liked where she was and she wasn’t going anywhere. This was sadly amusing because if someone had asked her where she was or why she was there, she wouldn’t have been able to tell them.</p>
<p>I explained to her that she couldn’t stay at the rehab facility because she refused to do her physical therapy and besides, we could take better care of her at home. I now know that my response probably sounded like a rebuke, as the strain of caregiving was once again creeping into our conversations. (Unfortunately, I didn’t realize it at the time.) Despite her resistance, we put Mom in a wheelchair, steered her out to my car and drove her to our house. When we got there she couldn’t walk, of course, so my husband picked her up, wheelchair and all, and carried her up our front steps—and there she was.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, we settled into a routine of doling out her daily meds and keeping track of her oxygen. My husband (who’s a great cook) cooked all her meals and everything appeared to be ok. However, Mom was very sick, and it didn’t seem likely that she would ever get better. Her body was quite swollen from the congestive heart failure, and she was extremely weak. When the physician’s assistant came for his first home visit (why did we so rarely see a doctor?), I again brought up the subject of hospice. He said he thought Mom would probably qualify and he’d be back in two weeks to check on her.</p>
<p>However, something else was going on with Mom. Since her near death experience with pneumonia, she had begun acting delusional again, much like she had during her first time in the hospital—but this was much worse. After we moved her into our house, she started lashing out at me at night and she seemed almost gripped by fear. We still needed someone with her at all times, so I did my best to keep her calm when I was with her. Pretty soon, though, my husband took over most of her care because I worried that I might be making things worse. I don’t know how he was able to do it. Her ups and downs were hard to watch, much less manage. Mom would gain water weight, which would cause her to struggle to breathe and she’d appear to be failing; then she’d get better; then she’d get worse. I finally called the physician’s assistant and told him what was happening. He said he would order a hospice evaluation.</p>
<p>Miraculously, ten days later, Mom’s health had slowly improved—sort of. Her water weight was down, she was making effort with her in-home physical therapy sessions and she seemed steadier on her feet. It even looked like she might soon be able to walk a bit without her walker. Perhaps she will live for a long time, I thought, or possibly move back to her own apartment. Yet at night, she continued to have nightmares and the focus of her suspicions was me. When I came downstairs each morning, she would be sitting at the breakfast table, whispering to my husband that I had come into her room the previous night and threatened her. Or if we were sitting alone together, she would glare at me and repeatedly say, “Why do you hate me?” I would try to tell her I didn’t hate her, I loved her, but my insistence was futile.</p>
<p>Like a perfect storm, the weather wasn’t helping either. We were having a record cold and snowy winter, so Mom was cooped up in the house day and night. I yearned to take her for a walk. One day, out of desperation, I opened the front door and let her sit in the doorway for a while. It seemed to help clear her mind. At one point, she turned to me and said, “You’ve had a hard time, haven’t you? I’m sorry for all this.” Words can’t describe how much it meant to hear her say that.</p>
<p>When the physician’s assistant came for his second visit, he decided Mom was doing too well to qualify for hospice. I had to admit that physically she seemed better. But otherwise, things kept getting crazier. She wanted to sleep by the front door at night because she thought someone was trying to get in. And she was totally paranoid about me. On the one hand I knew it was just her disease, but soon my health was being affected. I started getting headaches and toothaches, and I began to feel like an unwelcome guest in my own home. This left me sad and heartbroken. I had given my all to help her and now I had become her mortal enemy!</p>
<p>I realized, of course, that part of my reaction to the situation was due to my home life when I was growing up. Dad never hit Mom or me, but shouting matches and tirades were a matter of course. So now Mom’s delirious attacks, regardless of its cause, brought back my childhood feelings of wanting to flee or escape. And it was something I just couldn’t shake. I finally told my husband that if Mom’s condition stabilized and she began to walk without her walker, then we needed to move her back to her apartment.</p>
<p>One night, in an attempt to speed up the process and relieve me of my mental anguish, my husband decided to see if Mom could walk on her own. He asked her to take a few steps without her walker and she did-and then she fell. It was a very scary moment. And a defining one. I tried not to show my disappointment, but I was so miserable, I realized right then that either Mom or I would have to go. What a heart-wrenching realization that I could no longer be with my own mother.</p>
<p>So my husband offered to move Mom back to her apartment and take care of her there. (What husband does this, right?) As much as I didn’t want this to happen, I saw no other choice. The next day, I watched as he loaded her into his car and drove away, and I though about how Mom had been in our house for just fifteen days and already she was being forced to leave. Had I failed? I don’t know. I can only say I felt relief.</p>
