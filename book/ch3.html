        <h2>Change requires understanding</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="chbody">
        <p>Mom’s visit to the Emergency Room about her skin cancer had led to nine out-patient surgeries over a two-year period. A subsequent routine physical exam by her primary care physician had resulted in multiple prescriptions for hypertension and cholesterol, and numerous follow-up doctor visits.</p>
<p>Now, at the age of eighty-four, Mom seemed different. It was almost as if she had experienced some kind of trauma in the last two years that had accelerated her decline, although I didn’t understand what it was. Her memory problems appeared to be getting worse and the only thing she seemed to care about, which she mentioned with increasing regularity, was that she “loved her condo.” This comment was so pointed, I was certain she was trying to tell me something, but it was as if she was speaking in code, and I didn’t have a clue what it meant.</p>
<p>Several weeks after Mom’s last skin surgery, I flew down to Florida to see how she was doing. I discovered that she had stopped driving—and apparently run out of food. Mom always declared that driving was her freedom and she swore she would never give it up. Yet, I had no idea how good of a driver she was since she insisted that I drive when I was in town. So this new development puzzled me. Did she get lost on her way to the grocery store? Or have a near miss with another car? Did she forget how to park or how to fill up the gas tank? To this day, I don’t know what happened because she never told me.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, this not-driving thing was a big deal. As I mentioned previously, public transportation was not an option with Mom, and she shuddered at the thought of her neighbors seeing Meals on Wheels at her door. And once, when I brought up the topic of long-term care insurance, she glared at me like I was sending her to the firing squad! So I was pretty sure that she hadn’t planned for this new juncture in her life, except (oh…now I get it) she loved her condo.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, I begged her to let me research some local senior services and/or retirement communities. Looking back, I think she said yes to this only to pacify me and stall for time, as she really had no intention of agreeing to any of it. Having previously visited friends in assisted living facilities, she had already crossed that option off her list. Perhaps those places reminded her too much of her past experience in the sanitarium.</p>
<p>At any rate, with my hopes up, I flew back to Ohio and optimistically returned to Florida a few days later with a list of places to check out. I hardly got through the door when Mom told me that she was glad to see me BUT she wasn’t going to visit any “old age homes”. And she didn’t want any senior services either. In fact, she didn’t want to change a thing. And, by the way, she loved her condo. Flummoxed, I stocked her kitchen with as many groceries as it would hold, paid her a short visit, and dejectedly flew home.</p>
<p>Two days later, Mom called me. She said she hadn’t felt “so blue” in a long time and she didn’t know why…she was really down. I tried to console her, but I knew I couldn’t keep traveling to Florida every two weeks to buy her groceries. So I said I’d call back once I thought of something. My husband suggested that perhaps she could move to Ohio and live with us. (I know, where did I find someone like this, right?) It was such a sweet offer, and yet every fiber of my being resisted. After two years of long-distance care, I was emotionally and physically drained and I didn’t know if I could continue to be her caregiver on a weekly, and possibly daily basis. However, since she was refusing outside help, and I was her only child and the only family she had, I couldn’t think of an alternative.</p>
<p>So I called back and told her that she had two choices left—move up north with us or starve to death. I know that sounds unkind, but I tried to say it in a nice way, and not betray the fact that I was fighting my own urge for survival to even suggest it. Perhaps she sensed my desperation, because she stated emphatically that she would NOT move-and hung up. Admittedly, I almost felt relieved. Yet, I knew something had to give. So my husband mailed her a handwritten note saying how much we wanted her to be with us as a part of our family. (I know, again, amazing, right?) and it worked. After a few days, she called back and said she was looking forward to coming. But she insisted on having her own place. She would not live with us.</p>
<p>Luckily, there was a condominium available just a mile from our house. It was on the twelfth floor and had a lovely view. However, it needed a lot of work. So for a solid week, I cleaned and painted and eventually moved in a few pieces of furniture. Then it was time to pick up Mom.</p>
<p>My husband agreed to help me. So the next day, I flew down to Florida first to get her ready. When I got there—you guessed it—Mom told me that she had changed her mind and she wasn’t going anywhere. It was all I could do to keep my composure as I explained that she couldn’t stay in Florida by herself. So she finally gave in, but she made it clear that she wasn’t happy about it and she wasn’t going to be of help.</p>
<p>Looking back, I had no idea what Mom was giving up by moving and what a step down this would be in her independence. Just my declaration alone that she could no longer live in Florida by herself must have been a huge blow to her ego. Could she have made other choices that would have made it easier for her to stay there? Perhaps, but those were choices she was not willing to make.</p>
<p>The next day my husband arrived and we started packing up Mom’s belongings. True to her word, she hid in her bedroom and made herself scarce during the entire process- which didn’t bode well. For four days, fourteen hours a day, my husband and I sorted, donated, pitched and packed her possessions until everything was finally ready. The next morning, he drove off with a trailer full of boxes and Mom’s car in tow—for the thousand mile road trip to Ohio. That same afternoon, Mom walked out of the condo and locked the door behind her, and she and I got into a taxi and rode to the airport. As we drove away, I noticed that she didn’t look back.</p>
<p>I guess Mom really did like to travel though, because our flight to Ohio was a delightful adventure. Mom often said how much she enjoyed flying and this was no exception. We weren’t able to get seats on the plane together, so she sat in the row in front of me. As usual, there was candy in her purse, and today it was Hersey’s Chocolate Kisses. During the two hour plane ride, she kept passing the kisses back to me, one at a time. Then she’d turn to me and smile, and start to laugh. I think the people sitting next to us thought we were crazy. But I loved that time with her. It was our private little joke somehow.</p>
<p>Once we disembarked the airplane, however, Mom’s mood immediately changed. She started to walk up the exit ramp and then suddenly stopped, as if she didn’t know where she was going. I took her hand and guided her, with a dazed look on her face, through the airport. Eventually, we got to my car and drove to her new home. It was a cold November day, but miraculously the trees still had their fall colors. I knew the view from her condo balcony would be stunning and I couldn’t wait to show it to show her.</p>
<p>When we arrived, we took the elevator up to the twelfth floor and I ushered Mom into her new apartment. I was surprised that she didn’t say much. Then I slid open the glass doors that led to the balcony and we stepped out. Below us, a thick forest of red, gold and yellow stretched in every direction. It was breathtaking. I waited while she took in the view. Finally, she said, “It’s really beautiful.” Then she added, “I want to go home now.”</p>
<p>I stood there in shock, trying to comprehend what I just heard. Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion swept over me as if I hadn’t slept in days. We went back inside and I reluctantly phoned my husband. He was halfway to Ohio after having driven non-stop for twelve hours. He listened to my tale of woe, and then he said, “Ok, tell me what to do.”</p>
<p>“Keep going,” I said. I told Mom, “We can’t go back today. I’m too tired. Let’s talk about it in the morning.”</p>
<p>Rather than leave her alone in the apartment, I decided to spend the night. I curled up on the floor of her empty guest bedroom and fell sleep. The next morning, my husband arrived with Mom’s belongings—and for some reason this cheered her up immensely. To my surprise, she announced that she would stay after all and I could go home now.</p>
<p>Thus began the two wonderful (if at times trying) years of settling Mom in Ohio, decorating the condo to her liking and including her in my husband’s extended family celebrations. She immediately became a delightful fixture in the lives of our two sons, my husband, his siblings and mother-and of course, me.</p>
<p>However, I also began to notice more signs of Mom’s dementia. At first, I thought it was due to the trauma of relocating and I imagined that it would clear up with time. But it didn’t. She would seem ok, and then out of the blue, she wasn’t. Time and time again there was a decline in some functionality or life skill. But rather than a fast, downhill slide, it was more like a slip and then a plateau, where everything seemed to stabilize. Then another slip and another plateau, a slip and a plateau, almost as if life was fortifying itself for the next plummet. Looking back, I believe there was mercy in all of this, although I didn’t see it at the time.</p>
<p>As Mom’s memory problems increased, I did my best to work around them, not mentioning what I saw and just allowing her to live “independently” in her new home, discreetly transferring one daily task after another from her to my responsibility. I’m sure at times she knew what was happening. Yet, like myself, she preferred to live in denial. When my husband tried to point out to me where this was headed, I wouldn’t hear of it. This was partly because, despite the inevitable changes, one thing didn’t change. Mom’s desire and ability to appreciate life didn’t diminish. I witnessed her enjoying little moments—spending time with family, being surprised by a beautiful sunset or devouring a bowl of ice cream. And as her caregiver, I wanted to maintain my optimism in hopes she could continue to enjoy life, however small those moments of enjoyment might be. Of course, it was up to her to take advantage of those opportunities. And she often did.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it wasn’t long before her admonition that she didn’t want “to be a burden” crept into our conversations, always followed by my irritated insistence that she wasn’t. I didn’t realize at the time that perhaps she had a vague sense of what lay ahead which compelled her to keep saying those things. And regrettably, I never asked her exactly what she meant.</p>
