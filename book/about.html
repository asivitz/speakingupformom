<p>As a kid, I loved to write. In fact, when I was nine years old, I “published” a newspaper and my first headline heralded the arrival of a neighbor’s new batch of kittens. Sadly, the newspaper folded after only two editions because I had to hand print each copy and I suffered from a severe case of writer’s cramp.</p>
<p>Years later, as a student at the University of Florida, my college counselor advised me to major in something “I was good at.” So, although I had a passion for art, I decided to major in journalism. I learned a lot about writing, and a lot about what I didn’t know about life. One particular day, my News Writing class was cancelled because my professor had committed suicide. I heard later that he left a suicide note in his typewriter. I’m sure it was well written.</p>
<p>Eventually, I met my husband and we moved to his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, where we raised our two sons. On a lark, I submitted a story to our local newspaper about my misadventures in attempting to <em>walk</em> our local running marathon (evidently, walking solo was not allowed). To my delight and amazement, the newspaper picked up the story—and offered me a job. (And the next year, the marathon allowed individual walkers to participate!)</p>
<p>I loved being a news reporter, and tried to be an agent for change in a city that rarely saw people walking or running. I filed over two hundred stories as a fitness writer and covered exercise trends like hot yoga and race walking; interviewed national celebrities like Richard Simmons and Montel Williams; and had my readers follow along as I got “trained” by a local trainer. However, like many caregivers of aged parents, when Mom’s illnesses became the priority, my news writing career came to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>Today, I continue to pursue my interest in natural healing and I’m a certified nutrition coach. But whenever I can, I try to use my writing to help others feel empowered to help themselves.</p>
