        <h2>At times, assisted living isn't very assisting</h2>

    <div class="chbody">
        <p>It was three days before Christmas and Mom was finally leaving the hospital cardiac floor where she had been sequestered for eight straight days. Although it was nearly nine o’clock at night, an ambulance was transporting her to the skilled nursing unit of an assisted living facility that I had picked out for her to do her rehab.</p>
<p>Actually, the ambulance ride turned out to be a bit cheery because the EMTs were in a holiday mood and had hung Christmas lights and a miniature Christmas tree inside the back of the ambulance—which Mom enjoyed immensely. When we arrived at the facility, I walked behind her as she was wheeled by gurney to the back of the building and then up the elevator to the rehabilitation wing. After we entered the unit, the door automatically slammed shut and locked behind us, and I was told that this was a combination Alzheimer/Rehab floor and was always in lock down. (In other words, it was the closest thing to being in prison without really being in one.)</p>
<p>It seemed the patients were already asleep in their rooms, except for a few poor souls who sat slumped over tables in the common area, their heads buried in their arms. We were led past them to the private room I had arranged for Mom and when I saw it, I was shocked. Why the bare, dingy-white walls and single lightbulb in the ceiling? What happened to the nice decor that I had seen in the assisted living area?</p>
<p>The nurse on duty was perturbed about getting an admission so late, and that Mom didn’t have a catheter. So I volunteered to spend the night (thinking I’d look for another rehab facility in the morning). I draped a blanket over the well-worn LazyBoy chair next to Mom’s bed and tried to get some sleep. Admittedly, this place gave me the creeps.</p>
<p>It was another restless night. Mom got up a few times and I took her to the bathroom. Now that the catheter was out, she did OK. However, she needed a wheelchair to navigate because she had forgotten how to walk. At least, thankfully, she wasn’t tethered to all those cords and tubes like in the hospital! The next morning, I decided Mom would stay here after all (and so would I). I hoped that her mental issues would subside now that she was in a slightly less hectic environment. I was also concerned that the ordeal of moving her again might make things worse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t realize the importance of the social and environmental cues that Mom had established at her apartment so she could function. Her daily newspaper told her what day it was. She wrote notes to herself like “Don’t wear the purple pants again” so she wouldn’t repeat certain things. And then there was her external identity—her wig, her wedding rings, her purse—that I took from her for safekeeping when she entered the hospital. She didn’t even have a mirror to look at herself! Unbeknownst to me, it was the absence of these things in the sterile environment of the hospital and the rehab facility that laid bare how poor her short-term memory actually was.</p>
<p>Another issue was that the rehab staff had labeled Mom a “high fall risk” because she could’t walk and yet she had a propensity to try to get out of bed. The ways to address this were either to tether her to the bed with arm restraints or to place a mat under her mattress that sounded an alarm when she got up. The first option wasn’t an option of course, and the second option didn’t work. The alarm would sound for fifteen minutes or more before anyone came to check on her. So, for two weeks, I camped out in Mom’s room twenty-four hours a day and basically became her safety net to keep her from falling. (The one night I tried sleeping at home, the next day the nurse told me that Mom had fallen out of bed during the night but she assured me that Mom hadn’t hurt herself.)</p>
<p>Mom’s therapy sessions started the morning after she arrived and I went along. Her first task was to start using a walker. Mom had always been thin, but today she looked extremely frail, and I noticed how much effort it took for her to follow the therapist’s instructions. Besides her weakened state, she obviously had no idea of where she was or why she was doing all this.</p>
<p>Two days into Mom’s therapy sessions, the staff wouldn’t let me go with her anymore, so she refused to go. When Mom decided not to do something, there was no point in trying to talk her into it. The therapist gave me a strong warning that if Mom continued to refuse treatment, Medicare might not pay for her stay. I had no idea what she was talking about because I didn’t know anything about Medicare and I hadn’t even thought about the cost or who was paying for it. But I did know Mom’s health wasn’t improving, and as days went by she seemed to be getting worse.</p>
<p>I tried to take her to the common area for activities but she wasn’t interested. I begged her to let me take her for a stroll in the wheelchair, but she refused. She wouldn’t leave her room and only got out of bed when they made her do so for meals (which she hardly ate) or to use the bathroom. She was quiet and she seemed depressed or preoccupied, and I was worried about her.</p>
<p>Late one night, as I sat in the common area watching TV, a nurse came up to me and asked how I thought Mom was doing. I told her I didn’t know, but it didn’t seem good. “I think she belongs in hospice,” she whispered to me. “Don’t tell anyone I said so. I’m not supposed to bring this up. I’d give her three months,” she added. As I watched her go off to her patient rounds, I considered what she had said. It confirmed to me that what I was observing about Mom was truly serious. And I now knew for certain that the medical staff was not going to bring up hospice unless I did.</p>
<p>I asked the Physician’s Assistant about hospice the next day. She said she would need a second doctor’s opinion to approve it. For some reason, it didn’t occur to me to ask for the resident doctor (whom I hadn’t met yet) and it wasn’t suggested. So I scheduled an appointment for Mom to be transported back to the hospital in a few days to see a local authority on congestive heart failure. It seemed that a terminal diagnosis of congestive heart failure was our only chance to get her out of this medical experiment that her life had become. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize that I could take her home at anytime. I still wasn’t sure of my rights as her health care proxy or hers as the patient.</p>
<p>However, we never made it to that appointment. The day after my conversation with the PA, it was Mom’s birthday. Mom asked me how old she was. “Eighty-seven,” I told her proudly. She stared at her birthday cards and said nothing. I could tell that at this juncture in her illness, she was slipping away. I knew she didn’t want to be in an institution. And she hated and feared procedures and doctors. It clearly wasn’t her intention to live as an invalid—and as she constantly reminded me, she didn’t want to be a burden.</p>
<p>So, two days later, when the unexpected happened, I felt OK about it.</p>
