        <p>As Mom entered her eighties, the most striking thing about her was her appearance. She still looked immaculately “put-together” and often dressed in matching pants and top, a decorative belt, costume jewelry earrings and two large diamond wedding bands. She also wouldn’t go anywhere without makeup and would whip out her lipstick at odd moments to reapply it. Then there was the set of blond wigs which she wore habitually. In fact, I never saw her without a wig until a few months before she died. And she always wore heels, no matter how low they had to be. (Alas, the sneakers I gave her one Christmas stayed pristine and unworn in her closet.)</p>
<p>In stature, Mom was medium height, slightly built, and could climb a set of stairs with the best of us (perhaps residual from her softball shortstop days in high school?) And thanks to her Alabama upbringing, she was a charming Southern belle with a slight Southern drawl that Dad chided her to suppress soon after they met. She was also extremely agreeable to the point of appearing to have no opinion at all. I suppose life’s situations had taught her that it simply wasn’t worth the trouble to speak her mind. At any rate, she seemed to get along with everyone and people obviously loved her.</p>
<p>Another thing that stood out about Mom was her uncanny ability to steer conversations away from herself. She was extremely private about her affairs—medical, financial or otherwise—and she never confided in anyone, not even me, except on a “need-to-know” basis. As a child, I understood her unspoken rule to never ask uncomfortable questions. It wasn’t until much later, perhaps too late, that I realized this was her way of coping with the traumatic events in her life.</p>
<p>So when I visited Mom in the Spring of her eighty-second year and saw that bandaid on her cheek, it was no surprise that she deflected my question when I asked why it was there. Yet, every time we went to the grocery store she made a bee-line for the bandaid aisle. I finally expressed my concern and she assured me there was nothing to worry about. It was getting better, she said. But I knew “it” wasn’t. Each successive time I paid her a visit, the bandaid was bigger.</p>
<p>One day, Mom and I were playing miniature golf in the muggy Florida weather and the bandaid fell off. It exposed a fleshy, ugly, mushroom-like growth on her cheek about the size of a quarter. I was aghast. She said she had been putting anti-fungal cream on it and it seemed to be shrinking. I told her it was obviously not shrinking and we needed to see a doctor, but she adamantly refused. I felt perplexed. What was she afraid of? And if she didn’t go to the doctor, what would happen to her?</p>
<p>That evening, as we sat on her apartment balcony watching the sunset, I took a deep breath and decided to broach the subject again, this time with a little tough love. “Mom,” I said, “We either get this thing on your cheek taken care of or I’m afraid you might die.” Silence. Her profile was stoic and unmoving as she stared at the sinking sun. Several minutes passed and I could hardly see her now in the deepened dusk. Did she even hear me, I wondered? Is it possible she thinks she has a choice?</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity, she finally said, “I will go to the emergency room, but I will NOT go to a doctor.” I recognized this stubborn streak at once. Yep, she was digging in her heels. It was either go to the E.R. or nothing. So we went.</p>
<p>Of course, the E.R. staff at the hospital thought we were crazy. The triage nurse insisted that they didn’t have an “emergency” dermatologist. I responded that we didn’t have a choice. So eventually a doctor was summoned who confirmed that Mom had basal cell skin cancer. He said that we needed to find a dermatologist right away for outpatient surgery. Then the E.R. nurse read me the riot act for “not taking care of your mother.” Mom just sat there quietly and didn’t say a word.</p>
