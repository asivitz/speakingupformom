        <blockquote>
What would you like to say to today’s caregiver?
</blockquote>
<p>People are generally not ready to take on the role of caregiver. It’s a very challenging role, particularly if there’s a little bit of dementia added to it and the patient is not totally cooperative. Sometimes there is already conflicts in the family—one person feeling, “Why am I the only one taking care of him or her. Why isn’t my brother, my sister, our cousins helping?” So there’s frequently conflict. And it’s not an easy thing to do, taking care of an elderly person. We have all these chapters in our life, and each of these chapters has its challenges. Childhood has its challenges, puberty, the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. And in the 70’s 80’s and 90’s, these are the challenges of that time period. The more prepared we can get, the more openly we can look at it, the more honestly we can communicate, the more we will find our resources and listen to them and benefit from them, and the more likely things will go very smoothly.</p>
<p>There’s one other point I’d like to make. Sometimes it does seem like the health of the person you are caring for will plateau and then plummet, and plateau then plummet again. This is a sign that things are not going well. When things are going well the person feels better, then plateaus, then feels better, then plateaus. Occasionally, a patient does have a minor plummet but the aim is that the patient is getting better. Diet, among other non-medical factors, can often play a role in this. Nutrition is not a popular subject with most doctors but it’s an important part of recovery.</p>
<blockquote>
When there are several family members and one is designated as the health care proxy, are there times when the proxy seems to “take over” the patient care and does not allow the other members to participate in the loved one’s care or decision making? Is there any caution about this?
</blockquote>
<p>This is very much influenced by the ongoing relationships among all the potential players with each other. It can be very challenging to provide support to an elderly parent. It is best if the health care proxy and the back up proxies and interested parties all work together and share the responsibilities and make it as pleasant for the supported person as possible. But everyone has their own way of doing things and potential conflicts abound. I say “be wise and steer clear.” The chance to witness this stage of life is a gift to you, one that can enhance your life. Each person needs to do their part as best they can. We can’t change each other. I suggest we focus on doing our part as best we can and steer clear of conflicts.</p>
<blockquote>
In your opinion, what are the challenges that someone who is a health care proxy faces?
</blockquote>
<p>The main challenge is to really take the time and have the communication skills to understand what the loved one feels is important in their life, what they want. As we’ve discussed, it’s a difficult conversation to have because people are reluctant to speak about dying or preparing for dying, and they often haven’t thought it through. Some people are pretty comfortable with it, but a majority are reluctant to talk about it. So that’s the main challenge for people who are a Healthcare Power of Attorney—to understand deeply what that person would want. You never know exactly what situation you will be in, what medical situation will be going on or whether the person will be conscious or unconscious at that time. It’s all of a bit of a shock when it happens, so how to be prepared for that is the crucial issue.</p>
<p>Sometimes dealing with the patient’s other family members is difficult. One person is feeling that the patient does not want a lot of involved care and invasive procedures done and that they are comfortable in just comfort care. Another family member is really terrified of that person dying and they want everything possible to be done. So that becomes a real conflict at a very difficult time if it hasn’t been worked through previously. It does happen where different members of the family have very different perspectives on what is important and unfortunately, they can get very angry with each other.</p>
<p>The other area that sometimes becomes an issue is money. The inheritance that the person is leaving behind becomes an issue and conflicts arise between members of the family even before the person has departed. There’s a lot of potential conflict regarding how money should be handled and unfortunately that can get in the way of just being present when the person is leaving. Sometimes people are in a hurry for the person to pass. It can bring out a lot of craziness in people.</p>
<blockquote>
In general, what can patients and their health care proxies do to avoid the scenario that happened in <em>Speaking Up for Mom</em>?
</blockquote>
<p>Just like what was illustrated in this story, I think lots of people are in denial. They don’t want to accept the fact that life has its limits, that we get old and we do die at some point. It takes effort to really understand what life is and how to enjoy it and benefit from it. When we find practitioners who we can really trust and communicate with, that’s a real plus. But sometimes we need to work on ourselves. A lot of people have painful emotional experiences that ultimately affect their health. Recently, I was seeing a patient who has so many ailments but at the core of it is a great deal of anxiety. So I decided I wanted to get to the root of the problem rather than just skirt around the outside. When I brought up the subject to her, she immediately began describing how painful her childhood was, some very traumatic experiences that had activated her internal stress system for her whole life, and our stress system, if activated, will throw off all the health building systems of the body.</p>
<p>So the first thing I would suggest is to find the ability to transcend those painful experiences as a child or as an adult, and engage in the medical community to make it work for you. People need to recognize that the medical community doesn’t automatically work for you. Just as doctors have so many regulations, patients have tremendous regulations. They have tons of rules and regulations from their insurance companies, i.e., “This is covered, this isn’t covered. Yes, we will cover this medication but it will still cost you $900 after we’ve paid our share.” It’s very shocking for patients to hear that, but it’s happening more and more. So it’s very difficult for a patient to feel safe in the medical arena but it is doable and it takes some work. And I see my patients are getting very skilled at it.</p>
