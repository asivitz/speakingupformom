If there is lack of trust between the caregiver or proxy and the loved one, how does this effect the decisions that need to be made?
</blockquote>
<p>Lack of trust makes decision-making much more difficult. To make good decisions and really understand what the loved one wants and what situation they would be satisfied with, it’s important to build that trust. And it’s often difficult because there is usually a long history of uptightness, anxiety or fear about treading into this new territory. So it takes time…and the way to do that is to let love be at the forefront of the relationship. Convey that you are doing what you are doing because you care, and that you want them to have the best experience possible because you love them. The more the person can hear this and start to trust it, the less past difficulties will be an issue. I think it’s extremely important to be able to listen and hear what the loved one is saying—and to repeat back to them what you hear them saying—so that they can tell you whether or not you are hearing them correctly, and whether they feel comfortable with your understanding.</p>
<p>It’s a delicate dance, and sometimes the person can get angry or upset. Or the person is incoherent because they have some dementia. That’s definitely a major aspect of the challenge. We need to understand that this whole experience of dependency is new for the person going through it. They’re not usually prepared for dying or being really sick or being unable to take care of themselves. And there’s this very real thing called, “I don’t want to be a burden.” It’s quite common among people in that situation, and it makes it harder for them to be helped. I’m constantly advising those patients of mine to allow others to take care of them. But people care about their adult children and don’t want to bring a lot of worries and difficulties to the child. It’s challenging.</p>
<p>The fact that we are mortal, that illnesses happen, that death happens—these things are not just possible, but guaranteed. And it’s hard to talk about them. It’s hard to bring up the subject, especially with people we love. But I think at some point in the future it will become a natural thing, and we will be able to share about it and look at it honestly—even with some humor. We can plan ahead, and when it’s not in the immediate future, we can be prepared and feel that when something does happen, we will know what to do. There will be a sense of “I know what I am going to do and I know how to handle it—and I know how to use the medical care system.” For instance, I think getting prepared to utilize the health care system would have made a huge difference in the way the system worked in the story of Speaking Up For Mom.</p>
<blockquote>
What part does/should the family doctor play in having a guided conversation with the patient?
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, the guided conversation begins between family members. Perhaps the health care proxy talks with their sibling(s) or other family member(s) of the loved one about what’s going on, and what can possibly happen next. Then the family starts talking with the loved one themselves. Maybe the family expresses, “We are worried about you. These things are happening…and we are considering different options,” to see if the person will talk about it. From the family members and then the patient themselves, hopefully some possible solutions begin to get sorted out. At that point, after there’s been this conversation and the family has tried working with the patient, it might be the time to bring it up to the primary care physician.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of times doctors want to play down their part in the conversation or make it a meeting about legalizing certain decisions, rather than really facilitating the conversation. A book called <a href="http://www.angelovolandes.com/the-conversation">The Conversation</a> by Dr. Angelo Volandes addresses how physicians can facilitate this end of life discussion with their patients, and this book can be very helpful to the physician. The doctor who wrote it is trying to train primary care doctors to become skilled in carrying on these conversations and to be willing to do so. He wants to create a revolution where the conversation about life-sustaining treatment is an automatic part of the relationship that doctors have with their patients, and that family members have with each other. So hopefully the topic will eventually be out in the open and it will be something that people will communicate about.</p>
