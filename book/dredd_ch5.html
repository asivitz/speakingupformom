        <blockquote>
Why are elderly persons often recommended for rehabilitation after a hospital stay, and does rehab really work for the elderly?
</blockquote>
<p>It’s just a natural fact of life that we are mortal and we don’t live forever. And the aging process is built into our biological system. So this means that at some point we are going to need to enter the health care arena, and that arena has some very nice wonderful aspects to it, but it also has its risks and dangers—and sometimes people end up getting hurt. Hospitalization is often a devastating experience for the elderly. These people are already frail and gently getting by, and then hospitals remove their freedom, their familiarity, their comfort, even their mobility.</p>
<p>There were studies done recently which showed that the third most likely cause of death and disability in the U.S. after heart disease and cancer is something called “iatrogenics.” Iatros is a greek word that means “we did it”. In other words, the medical problem was created by the medical treatment itself. There’s even a fifteen-hundred page textbook on the subject that lays out all the potential complications of surgery, pharmaceuticals and radiation—treatments being used in a hospital. In fact, when a person is admitted to a hospital they are subject to all sorts of unusual infections that they normally might not get. And then there is the incidence of hospital delirium, a hospital phenomenon which is usually due to the disorienting impact of the hospital environment. So why do patients often end up in a hospital in the first place? Many times it’s due to a physician’s fear of lawsuits and the desire to protect themselves. But we should only use hospitals if we really need them, as they are places that can be super dangerous.</p>
<p>Once in the hospital, a patient can benefit from their hospitalist writing orders to get them out of bed quickly and add physical therapy to their daily regimen to help maintain or regain their strength. And as soon as the patient is able, if more therapy is needed, a doctor’s order for rehab means the patient can now be moved to a somewhat safer environment outside the hospital for further recuperation. To the patient or healthcare proxy, it may sound like the doctor is ordering them to “transfer to a rehab facility,” and it may sound very intimidating. But it’s always the patient or proxy’s choice to refuse admittance to a rehab facility and try rehab at home.</p>
<p>I think rehab facilities have the potential to work for the elderly but they frequently don’t because those facilities are not especially good, and the patient doesn’t get the kind of attention they need. Plus, the elderly patient is often weak, unmotivated and depressed. So there’s all these forces working against a person’s recovery. For a lot of people, they also end up in rehab because the hospital doesn’t want to keep them. The hospital doesn’t make enough income on a patient who is just doing rehab and who doesn’t need other medical procedures. So the patient is sent to a lesser facility that has less equipment and a less skilled staff. (Although, this really depends on the facility.) But rehab is essential for getting well. Patients need to get back on their feet, to get their appetite back, to take care of themselves again, to get their brain function back. So a rehab facility has the potential to work, but it’s frustrating for the staff of such a place to work with the elderly because the progress is not that great. So it’s very easy to neglect elderly patients—and when that takes place, then bad things happen. Therefore, most patients do not like rehab facilities and want to get out.</p>
<blockquote>
Can a dementia patient get adequate care in a hospital or a rehab facility? If so, what does it take?
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely think dementia patients can get well in a hospital, but they are much better off if someone like a proxy or a family member is with them at all times, to protect them and make things go easier for them. The person who knows the patient needs to explain to the hospital staff, “Accommodations need to be made because the patient has dementia symptoms. Here are the things that the patient can really talk about and these are the things that they can’t.” The hospital staff is very busy and overwhelmed, so someone who is demented is very difficult to handle. The nurses want to be sensitive and caring, but it depends on what kind of dementia the patient has. If the patient is agitated and screaming, the nurses may want to move them somewhere else and tend to resort to medications to slow down the patient so they can’t carry on too much. It’s not a good situation.</p>
