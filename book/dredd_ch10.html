        <blockquote>
How does a patient or their health care proxy develop skills for speaking to a doctor, if obviously this is what is needed? What can we do to get better at this?
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a very good question and I don’t think there’s an easy answer. In medical school, doctors don’t learn a lot about communicating with patients. As individual physicians, we each have our own innate skill sets but we really don’t get intensive education on communication skills. So some doctors are good at communicating with patients and it comes naturally. They’re listeners, they take in what people are saying, they make time for it. Other doctors may be very rushed, going from room to room, and they don’t really have time to discuss anything. So it can be very intimidating and difficult to communicate with a doctor, particularly if the patient is bringing up questions about issues that the doctor has already decided upon. It’s as if the patient is challenging what the doctor is saying. And if that challenge strays into areas that certain doctors do not respect very much—like dietary supplements or alternative treatments—then the doctor may develop an attitude very quickly about the patient.</p>
<p>So I think it’s extremely important for the patient or the health care proxy to communicate well, and for proxies to realize that if they want to communicate on behalf of their loved one, then it takes some work on their part. Step number one is to do their homework. The proxy should understand what is going on with their loved one. To do that, they need to have an open communication with them, so that the loved one feels safe sharing with them, and so that the proxy can be in a position to help them.</p>
<p>They also need to do their homework in terms of understanding their loved one’s medical condition. If the doctor gives it a name, say, “Oh, the patient has cholecystitis.” Well, then there needs to be an understanding of what cholecystitis means. In this case, it’s inflammation of the gall bladder which could be caused by gallstones or it could come from a blockage. The usual treatment is surgical, etc. The proxy needs to prepare and think through some of these medical issues so their questions to the doctor will make sense. Now, I know it isn’t easy for people to do this because they are often already upset that their loved one is in the hospital or they are worried about what could happen to them. Or perhaps the proxy is busy and has their own family to deal with. But just taking a few minutes to research what is being said can make a huge difference in the communication with the doctor. And with our wonderful cell phones we can look up anything very quickly and get an idea of what the doctor is talking about.</p>
<p>So in the same way that doctors need to learn skills about how to communicate with their patients, patients and their health care proxies need to learn the skill of how to speak with the doctor, how to hold one’s ground, how to be respectful and yet how to stand up for what one has to say. If you are communicating disrespect to the doctor, then that tends to undo the communication. So it’s important to respect the doctor but that does not mean you need to agree with everything that person says, because you may have a different perspective and perhaps you can express it in a way that the doctor can hear it. I think this is an extremely important point and many doctors are prepared and ready for patient communication and are open to it. So I think it’s certainly something that people should work on and be prepared for and practice when they have the opportunity. In the patient advocate role, these skills can play a very important part in the decision-making at any stage of a loved one’s situation.</p>
<blockquote>
I realize that the patient, the health care proxy and the medical staff are all part of the same team, wanting to do what is best for the patient. However, if the proxy is stressed, worried and/or functioning on lack of sleep and yet needs to communicate effectively with the doctor, isn’t that quite a challenge?
</blockquote>
<p>I know how difficult it can be, and yet a lot rides on it. This is where the understanding comes in that to do this task well of being a health care proxy takes responsibility and takes effort. Some people get hysterical and emotional and create a scene at the hospital. That really doesn’t go over well.</p>
<blockquote>
Explain your definition of invasive and non-invasive procedures. Does it change with the situation?
</blockquote>
<p>Invasive procedures are ones that go deeper into the body. If you put a cream on your skin, for instance, that’s not invasive, it’s very superficial. But if you give an injection, that’s a little more invasive. If you actually cut into the body and remove something, that’s a little more invasive. If you put the person to sleep so that they’re under full anesthesia and then you open up a body chamber, that’s maximally invasive. So it’s kind of logical that the level of invasiveness means how deep you are going into the body for that particular procedure.</p>
<blockquote>
Is the age of the loved one a determining factor in whether surgeries and other invasive procedures should be pursued?
</blockquote>
<p>Age isn’t as much of a factor in determining the line of treatment as is the person’s physical condition. I’ll give you an example. I have a patient who is eighty-six years old and he had seen an orthopedist and the orthopedist recommended that he have major back surgery. I was doing the pre-op clearance, that is, evaluating him to see if medically he was cleared for surgery. As I examined him, I found a number of major issues with his health. His heart rhythm was irregular, and when I checked he was in atrial fibrillation, an abnormal rhythm of the heart. Then I checked his lungs and he had evidence of pretty advanced cardio pulmonary disease (COPD), which is like emphysema. Plus his blood pressure was very high, 200/130. So he had a lot going on medically, and I told him I could not approve him for surgery. But he wanted to proceed with it because he had been told that he needed the surgery and he really wanted to have it. So he went to a cardiologist and a lung specialist, and eventually they both cleared him for the surgery.</p>
<p>I finally got the report on this patient. He had excessive bleeding during the operation, and eventually his kidneys were failing and he was on dialysis, and now he has sepsis and there is a high chance that he’s not going to recover. So I’m constantly advising people not to have surgery who are scheduled to have it. I call it balancing the pros and cons. If you’re trying to make a decision, write down all the good things that can come from that decision and all of the potentially bad things. Then you can look at the list and usually it’s pretty obvious what decision to make. There are patients in their 90’s who have had operations that they have benefitted from and that were valuable for them, and there are patients in their 40’s who have had serious complications and very serious problems from surgery. So definitely age is a factor, but it’s not the key to the decision—it’s more about the patient’s condition, what operation is being proposed, how likely they are to benefit from it, and how likely they are to have complications afterward.</p>
<p>Post-op is the amount of time you take to recover from surgery—to get up on your feet, to get mobile and to establish adequate food intake. If you have surgical wounds, you need to keep them clean and dry and well protected so that they don’t get infected. There’s a lot of issues in the post-op period and the more health concerns brought into it from the pre-op period, the more difficult it is to recover and get well.</p>
<p>Here’s a very common situation: You have an elderly person who falls and breaks their hip. The doctor knows that if they don’t operate and fix the hip, the person will never walk again. So the doctor is very strongly oriented toward doing the operation, because they feel that if they don’t, it’s likely the patient will die.</p>
<p>But the health care proxy needs to understand the pros and cons of the choice to operate and to think them through, and then come to a decision with the doctor. The patient could have the surgery, that’s one option, but it means anesthesia, post-operative pain and physical therapy with painful legs. It’s going to be quite a difficult recovery. But if the patient doesn’t have the surgery, they will have pain from the fracture, they will be bedridden and completely immobilized and will probably die. Either way, the patient will probably die. So it’s a very difficult situation. Some people opt to not have the surgery, but I’d say the majority of people opt to do it because it’s such a pressure situation for the patient or proxy—the surgeon really wants to do it.</p>
<p>I’ve advised patients in this scenario many times.The patient falls, breaks a hip, goes to the hospital late at night and the doctor does the surgery early the next morning. In many cases, I’ve felt there were good results. The patient becomes functional and has some life left because they had the operation. However, if the patient’s overall health is very poor and their likelihood of recovering is very small or they just don’t want the surgery, then yes, there are situations where it’s obvious the person is just too ill to go ahead. There are then two choices and neither one is very appealing.</p>
<p>I have a patient who is ninety-five and who had hip surgery, but she never did the physical therapy that was required, so she never started walking. I kept urging her, “Do the physical therapy. Do the physical therapy.” But she never did. It’s now been a couple of years since her surgery and she’s been on total bed rest for those two years.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em> is another example. Such a sad tale and yet, one that is happening thousands of times throughout our country every day. It’s true that if surgery is not done for a broken hip the person will not be able to walk and often will die soon. But we have to ask ourselves if the person can survive the surgery and with what quality of life. The mother in this story needed a serious hospice evaluation when her daughter first brought it up, and then again when the nurse mentioned it in the rehab facility. Hospice shifts the focus from invasive to non-invasive, from intervention to comfort, from being lost and confused in the hospital to having time to say goodbye to the people you love. This mother and her proxy needed someone experienced in the medical arena to help them navigate this dangerous hospital terrain. Sometimes a doctor or a nurse will assume that role, but often the health care proxy is on their own to face these heart-wrenching decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
What does one do when the health care proxy can see clearly that the patient is suffering and the treatments proposed, although they may extend life, will result in further suffering?
</blockquote>
<p>These are not easy decisions. They are hard decisions. Definitely there are times when a doctor is presenting that a surgery is a good idea and it will allow the patient to live. However, the health care proxy may be feeling, “I don’t want to put my loved one through that suffering and pain and they are not going to live that long anyway.” So that’s when doing one’s homework is so important. The proxy needs an understanding what their loved one wants—and what other family members want is also helpful to take into consideration.</p>
<p>Once the health care proxy is clear headed, he or she can stand up for what their loved one wants and the medical staff will listen to them. It can be very, very challenging at times, and the hospital is a rushed environment and everything is an emergency. So it’s not easy to do this. But the more grounded the proxy is, the more knowledge they have, the more they understand their role, they can play a very important part in the decision-making.</p>
<blockquote>
When should a patient get a second opinion?
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I feel that second opinions should be very common place, particularly if an invasive treatment is being considered. With surgery, for example, second opinions frequently make good sense, depending on what is being proposed, for what reason, and of course, how urgent it is. Anytime there’s a question or uncertainty in the patient’s mind, a second opinion is a way to get another view of the situation and see if it matches the first view. However, if what the first doctor is proposing makes sense to the patient, if they feel very good about the doctor and the treatment is going well, then there’s no need for a second opinion. But if something significant is under consideration, it’s very good to have another perspective. The more information the patient has can only be a benefit. The one drawback is financial. Sometimes health insurance will cover the second opinion, and sometimes it won’t. But in general, I feel second opinions are very valuable and are worth the time and expense.</p>
<blockquote>
Should the patient tell their doctor when they are getting a second opinion?
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the patient’s relationship with the doctor. A lot of patients do tell their doctors. Often patients just say, “I’m going to see another doctor for a second opinion.” For instance, I had a patient recently who had injured her shoulder and her orthopedist would not strongly suggest that she have surgery. The patient wanted to resolve her shoulder issue quickly, so she and I discussed it and I supported the idea of her getting a second opinion and I even recommended the name of another orthopedist. Later, when I was talking to the first orthopedist, I mentioned to him that I had suggested that the patient see this other doctor. Hearing this from me, he seemed very positive about it. He said, “Oh that’s fine. That’s great. I think that will be good.” And I believe his attention to that patient’s care increased. The patient did see the other doctor but she felt more connected with the first, so she stayed with him. However, as a result of that second consultation, her care by the first doctor improved and it doesn’t seem likely that she’ll need surgery after all.</p>
<blockquote>
In general, how do doctors feel about their patients getting second opinions?
</blockquote>
<p>I think doctors accept it as a part of the game of practicing medicine. I’m sure there are doctors who wonder why it’s necessary, but I think it’s part of a patient’s efforts to understand more about their own situation. And a doctor could use it as an opportunity to understand more about what the patient is feeling, such as, “Do you have any concerns that I am not addressing? Do you have any questions that I haven’t answered? What can I do to help?” But at the same time, I think the doctor should be saying, “I think it’s great to seek a second opinion because it will be useful for you. I support it fully.”</p>
<p>Some patients seek out second opinions and don’t tell their doctors—that happens a lot. I think the important thing to note about this is that the medical care system needs to be more user friendly for patients, so that the patient can navigate the system, can get what they need and can get good care. The issue isn’t about how does the doctor feel. The issue is what kind of care is the patient getting?</p>
<blockquote>
Often medical facilities seem so understaffed and overworked, you can feel the stress among the staff…
</blockquote>
<p>That is a very important factor in the quality of patient care because hospitals are difficult places in which to work and they are usually understaffed. There’s more work than there are people to do it. I have a good friend who’s a nurse at a hospital here in Los Angeles, and she’s constantly exhausted. She feels such a challenge everyday trying to keep up with the demands of her patients. So nurses do care and they want to do a good job, but it’s difficult because of the increasing demands of the job and the lack of staffing.</p>
<blockquote>
I yelled at a nurse once during Mom’s first hospital stay and I sought her out later and apologized. But I was so frazzled at that moment and seeing them perform a procedure that caused Mom pain just sent me over the edge. It did get them to stop the procedure, however…
</blockquote>
<p>It’s good when there’s someone with a loved one who cares that that person is suffering. And there’s two sides to the equation. Can life be extended or can pain be diminished? Sometimes we approach these two things as if they are opposite. Perhaps to extend life means taking on more pain and more suffering. So you want to have balance in your decision-making such that you are aware of what’s too much, and what’s not too much. Thus, the patient or their health care proxy may be willing to consent to one treatment or procedure, but not willing to consent to a different treatment or procedure. Again, it’s important that the patient feel protected and feel that someone is on their side.</p>
<p>I do a lot of consultations where I understand the procedure that the hospitalist wants to undertake and I explain the procedure to my patient. When the patient fully understands it, then they are in a position to say, “That will be ok,” or “No, I don’t want that.” However, for a patient to be able to say, “No, I don’t want that,” their understanding of the procedure is required. Doctors need a patient’s approval (or the proxy’s approval if there is a legal arrangement) to do a procedure. The doctor can’t just do a procedure without patient approval. So in <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em>, for instance, the daughter gave approval for those procedures on her mom which she ultimately objected to and demanded that they stop. But the daughter gave the initial approval.</p>
