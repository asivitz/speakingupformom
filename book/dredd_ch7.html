        <blockquote>
Talk to me about palliative care. Is it helpful? If so, how?
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a recent distinction being made between “palliative care” and “hospice.” It used to be that hospice was palliative care. Now palliative care is basically, as I understand it, where you’re providing care, not to extend life or to cure the person or to help them get better, but accepting that they do have serious medical problems and you just want them to be a comfortable as possible in that process. So you might use morphine more commonly or use medicines to relax the person, give medicines sublingually so that they don’t need injections, and just focus on patient comfort rather than length of life. The trend is to try to be non-invasive so there’s a lot things you will not do—like dialysis, chemotherapy, big intravenous (PICC) lines, frequent blood tests. I don’t think it’s clear what the nursing staff would do differently if the doctor just wrote down “palliative care.” The doctor’s orders need to be more specific than that. And it’s not clear to me who would implement what. So to me, palliative care is an indirect way of saying, “We are not going to resuscitate this patient.”</p>
<p>The book The Conversation describes three levels of care that a person needs to choose from. The first is “life sustaining care” where anything that will extend the person’s life even a little bit is considered appropriate (i.e., intubation, intravenouses, artificial feeding). The second level of care is “limited care” where you are willing to accept treatments that help but there are certain very invasive treatments that you won’t accept (i.e., intubation, feeding tubes, dialysis). These are things that you feel are more painful than beneficial and you don’t want to do them, and you accept the fact that the patient may die in the process if you limit care. The third is “comfort care” where the only focus is on keeping the person comfortable. You’re not really trying to extend life, you just want the person to be comfortable and not to be suffering. The book refers to this third option as palliative care—so that the person is in as good a shape as they can be and can communicate as well as they can during the time that they have.</p>
<p>So I don’t think the distinction between palliative care and hospice is apparent yet. The hospice people understand the difference. But palliative care is just becoming a possibility in many places. Most hospitals feel as soon as a patient is on the palliative or hospice care that they have nothing more to offer the patient and the patient should leave.</p>
<blockquote>
What is the advantage of hospice for a critically ill, terminally ill patient, and what is the process whereby a patient is admitted to hospice by their family physician?
</blockquote>
<p>A determination of hospice for the patient makes everything clearer. A team of people from outside the hospital or home medical care agency get involved, and they know exactly what they want to do. They have all their doctor orders and they use different kinds of medicines than regular doctors use. So they basically take over the patient care.</p>
<p>When a patient of mine is ready for hospice, I just write an order for a consultation with a hospice agency and then the hospice agent comes and meets with the family, meets with the patient and comes back to me about whether the patient is appropriate for hospice. If the patient’s health proxy calls hospice directly, then hospice will call me and say that the patient has been evaluated and they feel that the patient is appropriate for hospice. But the doctor definitely has a role to play, because it’s usually the doctor who the patient’s family talks to about it first, and says, “We are thinking perhaps our loved one should be in hospice.” That gives the doctor the opportunity to say “No, they don’t need hospice.” But if you push a little bit, hospice is available to people and a hospice agency will make their own determination if the patient is eligible for it.</p>
<blockquote>
How can a hospital patient to be evaluated for hospice?
</blockquote>
<p>If your loved one is in the hospital, you can bring up hospice to whomever will listen to you. You can tell the hospital nurse, “I am interested in looking into hospice.” Or you can talk to the admitting doctor at the facility. You can call those doctors in their offices, you don’t have to wait for them to show up on site. And if you are not getting any response, again you can call hospice directly. You can ask the nurses, “What is a good hospice?” There are a lot of different hospices available, and it’s good to know which hospices are recommended. Then you can call up one or two of them and say, for instance, “My mother is in the hospital. I want to explore the possibility of hospice. What do I do?” They’ll guide you through the process. At some point, the attending doctor needs to get involved because he/she has to write the order for the patient to be on hospice. You are initiating the evaluation but the doctor will need to be involved. And, yes, Medicare will cover it. A hospice won’t accept the patient unless Medicare covers it.</p>
<blockquote>
Suppose the doctor is resistant to a patient being accepted into hospice?
</blockquote>
<p>Hospices are private agencies, they’re like home health care agencies, and sometimes they are even part of a home health care agency. So you can look up local hospices in the phone directory or online and you’ll find a list. Then you just call and say, “My loved one is doing this, this and this. and I’m concerned that she needs to be in hospice,” and they will guide you through the process. It’s possible they might say, “Well, have you spoken to their doctor yet?” And if you say no, that the doctor didn’t seem to want to talk about it, they might say. “Well, talk to the doctor first and then get back to us.”</p>
<p>But my impression is that hospice is available to do the evaluation. I’ve seen it many times. Patients of mine have ended up on hospice that I didn’t even know were applying to hospice. So I think it’s flexible. People who usually end up in hospice need to be there. And I do have patients in hospice who have been alive for a long period of time and are doing fine. The only thing the doctor has to say in order for them to be admitted to hospice and for the government to pay is that the patient’s life expectancy is six months or less.</p>
