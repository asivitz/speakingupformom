        <h2>Present fears are often rooted in the past</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="chbody">
        <p>It had been a week since we heard the Emergency Room edict that Mom needed to find a dermatologist for out-patient surgery on her cheek. However, she refused to go to a woman doctor or to a physician with a foreign sounding name. So we combed the city looking for the appropriate male physician who would also accept new patients (which in Florida, with its high incidence of skin cancer, was like finding a needle in a haystack.) At one point, we got so desperate, I called my husband in Ohio and he searched the internet until he finally found a doctor who fit the bill. Relieved, I scheduled Mom’s out-patient surgery right away.</p>
<p>The night before her surgery, as I was getting ready for bed, there was a knock on my bedroom door. I opened it to find Mom standing there barefoot and in her nightgown, looking very forlorn. “Do I HAVE to go?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, as firmly as I could. It was a defining moment. For the first time, I felt uncomfortably more like her parent than her child. As I watched her obediently pad back to bed, I shook my head. It was obvious how much she dreaded going to the doctor, but why? It didn’t occur to me that perhaps her fear was not so much about her current situation as it was about her past.</p>
<p>I wasn’t allowed to be with Mom during the surgery, but she acted brave and the doctor said she did fine. She must have been a tiny bit relieved to have that awful thing finally off her cheek. For the next month, she took her preventative antibiotics and followed the rather complicated wound care instructions as best she could. When the time came for the follow up appointment, she asked me to come along, so I flew to Florida again. One night, while we were out to dinner, she showed me something on her leg. It was another growth that had sprouted and it looked a lot like the one that had been on her cheek—and she said it was growing fast.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really surprised. Reared in the South, Mom had always been a sun worshipper. As far back as I could remember, she would sunbathe each summer until she sported a dark, golden tan. When she moved to Florida with Dad, she found herself in the land of perpetual summer and she loved it. Unfortunately, all those years of tanning and skin damage had finally caught up with her.</p>
<p>I delayed my flight home and we scheduled out-patient surgery for her leg. Mom went through another operation and, after I left, another month-long stint of wound care and antibiotics. When it came time for the follow up appointment, I suggested that she could go without me. She retorted that it was too far for her to drive; the taxis charged her outrageous fares; and the city busses were unsafe. I mentioned that Senior Services would give her a ride but she vehemently declared that this would embarrass her in front of her neighbors. So I flew down to Florida again.</p>
<p>At her second follow up appointment, we discovered seven new basal cell tumors. I was grateful that Mom no longer balked at the prospect getting the tumors removed. However, I saw clearly that my involvement was key to her cooperation. So I reluctantly put my writing career and my family in Ohio on hold to focus on her recovery. During the next two years, I spent twelve extended stays in Florida to support her during several more surgeries and the follow up appointments that went with them.</p>
<p>Yet, amid all the medical procedures and doctor visits, Mom and I had some very memorable times. It was almost like my childhood years again, when we had been inseparable. We went to the movies and saw “Dream Girls” and “Walk the Line.” We dined at Denny’s so she could get the “Senior Special”. We coupon- shopped at Walgreen’s for Kleenex and aspirin. We had pizza delivered and ate it while watching Mom’s favorite TV program “Wheel of Fortune”. Sometimes, we took walks in the park and held hands. Sometimes, we got the giggles over something silly and laughed till we cried. And we hardly ever missed a sunset.</p>
<p>Once the surgeries were finally over, the dermatologist told Mom that she needed to get a physical exam. Mom didn’t think so. And I agreed with her. She hadn’t seen a family doctor in years and she seemed fine except for the skin cancers. But I began to second-guess myself (perhaps that E.R. nurse was haunting me?) and I eventually suggested to Mom that maybe we should follow the doctor’s advice. This was the beginning of a very regrettable pattern—going against my gut feelings, and more importantly, ignoring hers, to comply with a physician’s wishes.</p>
<p>We decided to go to a health clinic near Mom’s condo, on the outside chance that she might be able to drive to her appointments. As it turned out, a clinic wasn’t the best idea. Each time she went, she was seen by a different physician so none of them got to know her.</p>
<p>On her first visit, she had a psychological evaluation. The doctor asked her where she lived and who the President was. Mom was her usual charming and funny self and the doctor passed her with flying colors. I was somewhat surprised at this because since undergoing the skin surgeries, there had been a noticeable change in Mom. Sometimes while we were watching TV, she’d ask me the same questions over and over. And she insisted on having the newspaper delivered, although I knew she wasn’t reading it any more. And why was she up at two in the morning, checking the lock on the front door? These behaviors worried me but I didn’t dare mention any of this to her or to her doctor. And neither did she.</p>
<p>The doctor prescribed low doses of four different daily medications and told me not to worry about Mom’s heart arrhythmia. What? I didn’t even know Mom had a heart arrhythmia!! (I can now appreciate that these Florida physicians seemed a little more experienced than their northern counterparts when it came to prescribing, or not prescribing, drugs for their elderly patients.)</p>
<p>Then the doctor ordered an ultrasound of Mom’s heart. She laid down on her back on a cot, and the tech came in and moved a metal wand over her chest while he stared at the ultrasound screen. After a while, he told her to roll over on her side. Then he told her to roll onto her other side. I could tell Mom was getting somewhat perturbed, so I asked if there was a problem.</p>
<p>“I can’t find her heart,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?” I asked, and the three of us burst out laughing.</p>
<p>With that, the tech left the room and came back with his supervisor. The super read Mom’s chart and then moved the wand down to her waist. Sure enough, there was her heart. Since Mom’s left lung had been removed from her chest during her tuberculosis surgery many years before, there was nothing to hold her heart up there.</p>
<p>When we came out of the exam room, the clinic staff was gathered around Mom’s ultrasound picture and the doctor was pointing to it. As we stood there, he proceeded to explain with aplomb that this was the way doctors used to treat tuberculosis in the 1950’s, before there was medication. I could tell Mom was dying of embarrassment.</p>
<p>It never ceased to amaze me how doctors would talk about Mom right in front of her as if she wasn’t there.</p>
