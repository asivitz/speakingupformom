        <h2>Despite our best efforts, things happen</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="chbody">
        <p>After two weeks in our home, and failing to “qualify” for hospice, Mom was back in her apartment and my husband was taking care of her. At night, he slept on the floor outside her bedroom to keep vigil, because she was still waking up delirious and afraid. He said that at first she talked about witches, but eventually things got better.</p>
<p>Now that Mom was out of our house, I felt some stress relief and was able to visit with her during the day. During one of my visits, she had difficulty breathing and complained of chest pains. Was it another heart attack? I gave her some heart medicine and that seemed to help. Yet, the episode reminded me of just how fragile she was—indeed, anything could happen at any moment.</p>
<p>Eventually, I told the physician’s assistant why we had moved Mom back to her apartment, and he prescribed her an anti-psychotic drug. This seemed like an extreme measure and I hesitated to use it. One evening, however, as I was putting her to bed, she had another twilight meltdown and accused me of sneaking into her apartment to harass her. The venom in her words totally caught me off guard and I was truly devastated. I decided right then and there that I couldn’t be with her until her paranoia diminished. So my husband began giving her the anti-psychotic medication—which didn’t help—and she continued to have delusions. I finally told him to say that I had gone on a business trip, hoping that she might eventually forget about me.</p>
<p>Yet, I was desperate for answers as to why she kept attacking me. So I arranged for a psychologist to come to Mom’s apartment and do an evaluation. My husband said that Mom asked the psychologist, “Did my daughter put you up to this?” and that the examination was extremely distressing for her. Plus, it proved to be a fairly big waste of time. The one thing I learned was that she had very little short term memory. How does a person function without a short- term memory? In Mom’s case, I guess it was both a blessing and a curse. It allowed her to forget the pain of her predicament, but she also wasn’t able to understand why she was in that predicament in the first place. I was also told that she might have a combination of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although there was no explanation given of why those chronic diseases worsened suddenly during her first hospitalization and again after her second.</p>
<p>Physically however, Mom seemed to be making great progress. My husband reported to me that she was walking further and further with her walker; she didn’t need her oxygen for hours at a time; and he was giving her less and less of the diuretic drug because her water weight had begun to stabilize. Eventually, he was able to stop the drug all together and amazingly, Mom stopped hallucinating. (Why didn’t anyone mention to us that delusions could be a potential side effect of this drug?) So, after two weeks of not seeing her, I decided that it was time to return.</p>
<p>I had imagined Mom’s home medical care might go on for months, but she was doing so well, the occupational and physical therapists soon discharged her and the home care nurse came for a final visit. Unfortunately, the nurse arrived complaining of fighting off a nasty stomach flu and within two days, Mom had it as well. So even though her home therapy sessions and nursing care appointments had ended, the flu took its toll and soon Mom wasn’t nearly as strong as she had been just days earlier. She couldn’t walk nearly as far with her walker. She needed her oxygen more often. And no matter what we tried or the doctor prescribed, she couldn’t shake that stubborn stomach flu.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, we had to put Mom back on the diuretic medication because her water weight started creeping up. Before long, she was staying up most of night and sleeping most of the day. When I asked her why she didn’t sleep at night, she answered, “Because it’s more interesting at night.” Oh boy, what did that mean? She was probably experiencing hallucinations again, but thankfully, she didn’t mention it to me. So I too moved into the apartment to help take care of her. At that point, either my husband or I had been by Mom’s side constantly for about three months. One day, she asked why one of us was always with her. I couldn’t bring myself to say, “Because you can’t be left alone.” It would have broken my heart to say that. So I explained that it was because she took off her oxygen tubing and didn’t put it back on, and she needed it, which was true. Mom would often follow the tubing around the apartment or gather it up in her hand and ask, “What is this thing? Why am I wearing this?” And then she would take it off and leave it somewhere.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our present caregiving arrangement didn’t answer two looming questions, “What’s going to happen to Mom?” and “What are we going to do?” Something had to be decided soon because my husband and I were running out of steam, both physically and emotionally. We couldn’t continue to live at her apartment and I wasn’t mentally ready to move her back to our house. So we started looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>Very soon came a day that, regrettably, answered those questions. It began with me going to see a new assisted living facility. This one had a nurse’s station on every floor and a doctor on call, yet it looked classy and felt more like a normal apartment building than an institution. Looking back, I don’t know what I was thinking. From every indication Mom had made in the past, she would have never have wanted to live there. However, we were desperate to find a solution and her physician’s assistant had said he didn’t think she needed to be in a memory care unit (which both surprised and delighted us), so this place seemed ideal. Plus, the cost was less than half of what around-the-clock private duty home care in her apartment would have been, so I signed the contract that very day and put down a deposit.</p>
<p>Mom had been fretting about what was going to happen to her, so when I got back to her apartment, I enthusiastically told her about this new place and showed her some pictures. She seemed pleased. That night, as I tucked her into bed I thought about her question of why we were always with her. I decided that rather than camping out in the living room to keep an eye on her nighttime wanderings, as we usually did, this night we would sleep in the guest bedroom so she could have some privacy in case she wanted to explore her apartment a bit.</p>
<p>My husband was fast asleep when I heard the thump of Mom’s walker as she went past our bedroom door. Keeping with my decision, I decided not to follow her. Besides, I knew if I put her back to bed she would just get up again and this was her only opportunity for a little solitude and freedom. As she passed by, I peeked in the hallway and saw that the oxygen tubing had followed her into the kitchen. Good. I could hear her rummaging through kitchen drawers, opening the cabinets and checking the front door lock. After about fifteen minutes, I heard the walker again as she headed back to her room.</p>
<p>A few moments later there was a loud thud. My husband and I both leapt out of bed at the same time and found Mom sprawled out on the floor of her bedroom, the walker standing just a few steps away. Evidently, she had reached her bedroom closet without using it and had fallen as she tried to get back to bed. Now, her hip was killing her and she couldn’t get up.</p>
<p>It was one a.m. and I knew she (and we) were exhausted. So I decided to let her rest where she was. I had no idea what lie ahead, but something told me it was going to be a very, very long day. I covered Mom with a blanket and laid down on the floor beside her.</p>
<p>Then we both fell asleep.</p>
