        <blockquote>
Why do medical crises with the elderly often occur at night and sometimes out of the blue?
</blockquote>
<p>It depends mostly on what medical condition the person has and how stable their condition is to begin with. Medical crises are more noticeable at night because the incident is scarier and there’s more of a helpless feeling. Heart attacks can occur at any time, but during the day if a person has a little chest pain they can call their doctor and they have access to resources. But at night, it’s much more terrifying. The person either has to call the paramedics or do nothing. So I don’t know if these situations happen more often at night, but there are certain things in medicine that can happen abruptly and suddenly, like a stroke or a heart attack, and these are conditions that build up gradually and very silently, and then when they hit it’s an overwhelming and huge event. But these things have been developing gradually for years before they actually happen.</p>
<blockquote>
How common are adverse drug reactions in the elderly? What can we, as their caregivers or health care proxies, do about it?
</blockquote>
<p>What we see developing in medicine is an assumption that for every human ailment there is an unusual chemical substance which is the answer. We’ve all heard of the incredible side effects that occur with these substances. Just listen to any television commercial that advertises a medication and then cites its side effects. Yet, we seem to be in a state of denial about it, as if to say, “If we don’t acknowledge the side effects, they won’t happen.” I think side effects and adverse reactions to medicines are extremely common. So the patient or the health care proxy needs to be aware of the most likely side effects of a medication. The problem is that if you familiarize yourself with the side effects, you probably won’t want to take it or give it to your loved one! But it’s a good idea to try and keep the use of medicines as minimal as possible; be aware (or ask) the loved one if the medications are helping or not; and know the most common side effects in case they present themselves.</p>
<p>One thing that patients and their health care proxies need to realize is that patients can say no to any medical treatment at any time. Some patients are very proactive in deciding what treatments and/or medications they will accept. And some doctors resent this—but others appreciate it. Patients need a supportive environment to realize that they are in control. For instance, there’s one blood pressure pill I often prescribe who’s most common side effect is an annoying dry cough. This may seem like a trivial side effect, but it’s the main reason some people stop taking the medication. When that side effect happens, I just suggest something else. As I’ve said, I feel the human aspect of medicine is extremely important…helping people help themselves, helping people understand themselves, and helping people play a very active role in getting themselves well. Unfortunately, this aspect of medicine is not developing half as fast as I would like to see it happen!</p>
<p>However, one thing that excites me is the current developments in alternative medicine. Ever since my physician internship days, I’ve been looking for other ways of doing things, safer ways of practicing medicine. I’ve practiced wholistic medicine and now I practice integrative medicine. And then there is something called functional medicine, where doctors are really doing things the way I like to see them done. They look for ways to work with the human body rather than giving out these foreign substances to patients that block the functions of their bodies. Did you know that most of the medicines we take today block the normal functions of the body—for example, beta-blockers, channel blockers, ace inhibitors? These medications are created to block natural bodily responses and in doing so create side effects that might be beneficial. So that’s why there are so many side effects. We’re prescribing things that are at the same time alien to the human body and supportive of the human body. In functional medicine, we look at the function of the body and try to support it by recognizing that it has an extraordinary potential to heal itself and get well. What the functional medicine physician tries to do is work with that innate healing capability.</p>
<p>I think these two sides of modern medicine, traditional and alternative, are coming together. Functional medicine is not an outlier anymore. More and more, alternative medicine is becoming mainstream. And traditional medicine will have to shift, because alternative medicine has a lot of truths in it that need to be recognized and accepted. So I’m optimistic that this transformation will happen. In fact, I feel that I’ve been a part of it for my whole career. That’s why I think the communication aspect of medicine cannot be neglected. I find it to be the most rewarding part for both the doctor and the patient, and it’s in this arena where so much happens. That’s the kind of beings we are—we can express ourselves really well and we can eventually understand ourselves. Actually, I think the essence of getting well is to understand ourselves, and medicine will eventually evolve to support that, although I think it will be a bumpy ride. But I think it will ultimately go in the right direction.</p>
<blockquote>
Do you agree with the statement “Our health care system is not really set up to serve people over 80 years of age?” Why or why not?
</blockquote>
<p>The challenges that people over 80 years of age face are serious medical issues. Of course, there’s a wide variation. Some people are healthy into their 90’s and some people are really sick in their 70’s. But we have to recognize that old age has its unique features. It’s a multi-faceted weakening of the body, and there’s always the looming possibility of dying in the process of a medical procedure. So what we can achieve medically is limited. People have a kind of fantasized view of surgery. “Oh, surgery…they’ll just go in and remove my pain and I’ll be back to normal.” But you’ve got to realize that the tool that is being used in surgery is often a knife. When you think of your body, what can you accomplish with a knife? It’s limited and it’s painful. Yet, surgeons do open heart surgery on people who are 85 years old!</p>
<p>People come to me for medical clearance for surgery and my first question to them is, should they have the operation? I’ve convinced a lot of my patients that they are better off without an operation. And by and large, it’s worked out really well. Frequently, they do fine without surgery and their symptoms disappear and don’t come back. I’m an integrative doctor so I’m always looking for natural remedies that can help people. And I think there are lots of things that can help. But with the elderly, we’re working against death, so a doctor can do everything that they can, but there’s still a force that is taking the person down. So it’s a delicate path to walk. But I have several patients in their 90’s and they’re amazing. Some of them are really vibrant and energetic and doing well.</p>
