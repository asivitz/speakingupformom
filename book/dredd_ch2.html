        <blockquote>
As a physician, what do you feel is the most important factor in taking care of a patient?
</blockquote>
<p>I think the most important factor is the patient’s understanding of themselves and their active participation in protecting their own health. We each have a body and there are certain weaknesses in our bodies. I mean, of course, the human body is incredible. Think about how a baby is conceived, what it involves…two cells come together. They’re microscopic and you can’t even see them, you don’t even realize they’re there. That one cell then embeds inside the uterus and this little one cell now has all the understanding to create a heart, a brain, kidneys, an immune system. It’s just phenomenal, and yet it’s done so well so often, the vast majority of time it comes out just fine…but it is miraculous. Every human being is absolutely miraculous, and all the other animals are as well. So we are given this body and the most important thing, I think, is for the individual to understand that it is a gift and they are the caretakers. No one else is going to take care of it for them and what doctors are is consultants, people who can help us to understand. But the key to a person’s health is the individual role that they themselves play.</p>
<blockquote>
I’ve heard that care by a gerontologist is very expensive. How necessary do you think it is to consider that specialty when selecting a doctor for an elderly loved one?
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s at all necessary. Most internists (Internal Medicine doctors) are skilled in taking care of elderly people and I don’t think a geriatrician would do it very differently. Sometimes, elderly patients in my community will see me and will also see a geriatrician. I think perhaps they get some ideas that are helpful, but I don’t exactly know what they are being told that is different. However, whatever a patient can benefit from is fine. I think the value of seeing a geriatrician is up to the individual. It’s worth checking out for certain people, as they might be told some little tricks for their health. Many of the problems of the elderly are simple but annoying problems because they persist—like skin problems, digestive problems, and high blood pressure. When the problems get to be quite complicated, that’s when specialists tend take over, but at the level of the primary care doctor or the geriatrician there’s usually simple things can be done that might help the person.</p>
<p>Taking care of the elderly is a major aspect of internal medicine, in fact it’s most of our practice. I have younger patients as well, (Internists see patients age fifteen and above) and I like the diversity. And there are subspecialties of internal medicine like cardiologists, kidney specialists, endocrinologists, neurologists and dermatologists. A lot of times people seek out specialists for their care once they have a diagnosis, but I encourage them to have a primary care doctor in addition to their specialists.</p>
<p>Family care physicians have a different training program from Internists and most family physicians are trained to take care of children as well as adults. I’ve always felt that a family doctor is more of a general doctor, whereas internists are specifically trained to understand the internal workings of the body. Therefore, I’ve always seen internal medicine as a more in-depth understanding of what goes on in adults, and of course, all those sub-specialties I mentioned come from internal medicine. But there is a lot of overlap in those two areas of primary care, and some doctors in family practice might be more knowledgable and capable than an Internist. It really depends on the individual. The most important factor is the attitude of the doctor—is he or she genuinely caring?</p>
<blockquote>
Tell me about your perspective on Integrative Medicine. What kind of treatments do you include?
</blockquote>
<p>I consider Integrative Medicine to be a completely fresh perspective on practicing medicine. Integrative Medicine has evolved. It was first known as wholistic medicine; then it was complementary medicine; then alternative medicine; and then functional medicine. And now some people call it “integrative medicine.” I see it as having fundamental principles that are different from traditional medical practice. There’s some overlap, but it’s a fresh way of looking at people’s health issues.</p>
<p>One of the principles of Integrative Medicine is to look at the whole person. The bio-psycho-social model that we were taught in medical school is that when you treat a person there is a biological or physical aspect; a psychological or emotional aspect; and a social aspect, i.e., the patient’s job, family, relationships. All of these things can affect the person’s health, and all of them need to be part of the consultation, because you don’t really know which part is playing an important role for that particular patient. So that’s principle number one of Integrative Medicine—treat the whole person.</p>
<p>Principle number two is to respect the extraordinary capacity of the body to take care of itself, to heal. It has a built-in healing mechanism, a built-in elimination mechanism, and an immune system. It has an extraordinary capacity. So a major role of the doctor is not so much to bypass that capacity, but to work with it. How do you support the body? How do you help the patient function better so that their body can take care of lots of problems, rather than using strange chemicals (which is how I refer to pharmaceuticals) as your primary remedy?</p>
<blockquote>
Does Integrative Medicine differ at all from the other practices you mentioned? And is it still more of an outlier or is it becoming mainstream?
</blockquote>
<p>There are subtle differences between wholistic, alternative, functional and integrative medicine. If you go to the Functional Medicine Institute, they will tell you how functional medicine is different from everything else. If you go to an Integrative Medicine meeting, they will tell you how they are different. But in general, I think the words are used interchangeably and most patients don’t know the difference between them because this whole integrative movement is really a revolution waiting to happen. Little aspects of it are happening and people are slowly finding out and getting attracted to it, but it hasn’t yet made the full leap into medical education and into the practice of traditional doctors.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Hyman, who’s President of the Functional Medicine group, has done a lot of really good work. He was recently pursued by the Cleveland Clinic, which is a major traditional medical facility and very highly respected, to practice Functional Medicine there. He negotiated with them and they gave him an entire floor and a full staff, and now he’s doing functional medicine for the Cleveland Clinic. I think a lot will come from that, as traditional doctors see that traditional places can use an alternative method and benefit from it. I think the whole way medicine is practiced is going to change. However, I’ve been at this for fifty years and it hasn’t changed that much. So It’s hard to say how long it will take.</p>
<blockquote>
Would I be able to find an Integrative Medicine physician in my city?
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you will be able to find them. If you google “Integrative Physicians in (your city)” I think you will get a number of possibilities. And if you go to any of their medical societies like the Integrative Medicine Society or ACAM (The American College for the Advancement of Medicine) or the groups that represent these different schools, they will be happy to find a doctor for you in your area that practices the way they teach.</p>
<blockquote>
What are some typical treatments that an Integrative Medicine doctor such as yourself might turn to, and at what point do you determine that traditional treatments for a particular patient would not be as beneficial as the integrative side?
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not the way it works for me. I start out with a complete evaluation of the person, where I try and look at all the aspects affecting their health. Then I follow up with a second visit to go over the results of the tests and give my impression. And my impression is looking at the whole person from the beginning. So, for instance, a major aspect of a person’s health is nutrition. Are they understanding nutrition? Are they doing things that are going to help their body? Do they have food allergies? Do they have digestive problems? We have a nutritionist in our office and a lot of our patients will see the nutritionist as well. So that’s one area that is extremely important.</p>
<p>Another area is the approach to treatment. We prefer natural remedies. We’ll use medications when they are indicated and appropriate, but I think we use them less than traditional doctors do. And we have a little natural pharmacy of our own, where we carry the products that we’ve had good results with, so people can get them there if they want. We use a lot of other schools of medicine. We’ve had an acupuncturist working with us and a massage therapist. We try to find other modalities that will help people get well, but are not as dangerous and toxic as traditional medical remedies.</p>
<blockquote>
Are all integrative medicine practices set up the same?
</blockquote>
<p>Its hard to say because I haven’t gone to any integrative doctors myself, but I would think that each doctor has their particular slant on it but the basics would be similar—the tendency to use more natural remedies, the tendency to use alternative systems of care, other schools of medicine and the emphasis on nutrition. Another big emphasis in Integrative Medicine is dealing with stress, so that stress is not a major factor in a person’s health. We have a book we wrote about this called <em>The Inner Game of Stress</em>. Stress is recognized to really effect every system in the body, and major organizations have said that 90% of doctor visits include stress as the major component of the visit. So it’s important to recognize the role of stress but most doctors do not have any approach to dealing with it. Perhaps they send the person to a psychologist or start them on a tranquilizer, but those options are not what the patient wants or needs. And frequently, doctors do not know how to deal with stress themselves.</p>
<p>In the 1970’s, the alternative health community claimed that diet was a major factor in the occurrence of cancer. And traditional doctors completely ridiculed anyone who said diet had anything to do with cancer. Then in the 2000’s, on the front page of a major medical journal, it said, “Diet is a major factor in cancer.” It was like they had just discovered it and they didn’t give any credit to those who had been saying the same thing for thirty years. But because they had suddenly discovered it, it was significant. This journal also said some 70% of cancers were related to diet. And today it still doesn’t really sink in because most doctors don’t have a good diet themselves. In fact, I read a study once that said doctors will usually recommend their own diet to their patients.</p>
<blockquote>
Do doctors who practice this way accept major medical insurance?
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of the doctors that practice this way do so outside of insurance. This is because insurance providers start questioning how they’re practicing and then start notifying authorities that this person is doing this and this and this, and doctors end up getting legal hassles because they are outside the traditional medical practice. So a lot of doctors do not do it on insurance.</p>
<blockquote>
I’ve had experiences where if I question something the doctor says they seem to take it personally. Is this experience unique?
</blockquote>
<p>It definitely happens. Especially if the patient is interested in alternative treatments like integrative medicine and starts mentioning vitamins, for example, the patient frequently gets strong reactions from the doctor like, “That’s completely worthless!” So it’s definitely possible. But I think there are many doctors who would not do that and who would respect the patient’s feeling about it.</p>
