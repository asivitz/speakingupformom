        <h2>Necessity is the mother of invention</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="chbody">
        <p>After just twelve days in rehab, and a sweet near-departing, Mom was in the hospital for the second time in a month. I was kicking myself for agreeing to this. Why were we here? Somehow it felt wrong. Immediately, another IV was inserted into her arm, and the heavy-duty antibiotics began to work. Soon she awoke from her deep state of leaving us as if she had been in a dream—and she looked at me and smiled. I had never seen her look so peaceful. “My little Lindy,” she said, and she squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, her appetite was good and she seemed to be bouncing back a bit from the pneumonia. However, in addition to the antibiotics, she was once again receiving diuretic drugs because she still had congestive heart failure and fluid was building up in her lung. Added to this, she now was receiving oxygen 24-hours a day, with a tube running from her nose to a compressor machine nearby. Despite my pleadings, the Med/Surg doctor and the cardiologist refused to qualify her for hospice. Instead, they agreed to order palliative care. I had no idea what palliative care was, but it didn’t seem to change the situation at all except for discontinuing a few of her routine meds.</p>
<p>One thing that did become obvious though was how much the nurses in the hospital relied on me to take care of Mom. I was there day and night, and at one point when I left her for a few minutes to track down a vending machine and scrounge something to eat, a nurse met me when I got back and proceeded to chastise me for leaving Mom alone. She caught her trying to get out of bed, she said. What is their job anyway, I wondered?</p>
<p>After another three day stint of confining Mom to her bed, the hospital finally decided to discharge her back to the rehab facility. Before we left, the nurse came in and disconnected her IV, but said she wanted to insert a more permanent (PICC) line to deliver Mom’s antibiotics. I didn’t know what a PICC line was, but it sounded invasive. Against my better judgement and with the nurse’s insistence, I said ok without asking what the procedure would entail. I was told to stay out of Mom’s room while they did it, and three nurses worked on Mom for over twenty minutes. When they finally came out, one of the nurses said they weren’t successful and wanted to try again. I told them absolutely not—and they left.</p>
<p>At the last minute, before Mom could leave the hospital, the doctor ordered an echocardiogram. Again, I said no to this, but the nurses convinced me that it was just to get a picture and it wouldn’t be invasive. Mom was brought down into the basement of the hospital and we waited in a hallway for half an hour before we were finally brought in for the scan. Then the tech spent nearly an hour searching for Mom’s heart (which he couldn’t find and didn’t get the pictures he wanted anyway). The worst part was Mom had to pee and was forced to use a bed pan during the procedure, which thoroughly embarrassed her. I felt so bad about it.</p>
<p>It was evening when she was transported back to her old room at the rehab facility. My husband agreed to start spending the night in the LazyBoy chair next to Mom’s bed because I was so sleep deprived I just couldn’t do it any more. From then on, he stayed with her each night and I stayed with her during the day. Once again, she refused to go to her therapy sessions, and she still frequently got up from bed (or tried to). The one new addition to her situation was that now she had a tube under her nose for oxygen and since the oxygen tubing followed her everywhere, it was an additional fall risk factor.</p>
<p>Three more days passed, and Mom seemed more alert. One afternoon, I took her for a stroll in her wheelchair and she seemed to really enjoy it. At one point, she said, “Don’t give up on me.” I said I wouldn’t. But I knew I could never do the hospital thing again. Not with her dementia. It would be too much for both of us.</p>
<p>A day later, after living in Mom’s room for almost a month, we finally met the rehab facility doctor for the first time. We watched him sign Mom’s Do Not Resuscitate order and it dawned on us that this was why the physician’s assistant had frantically wanted Mom to go to the hospital when she had pneumonia. He also told us that pneumonia used to be called the “old people’s best friend” because it was such a peaceful way to die. I won’t write here what I was thinking when he told me that. But it just confirmed to my husband and I that, after a month of being in rehab facilities and hospitals, it was time to get Mom out of there. Besides the risk of infection, it just seemed better (and easier) to care for her at home. And lo and behold, when we told the nurse of our plans, the rehab social worker suddenly appeared with information about home nursing care.</p>
<p>We enlisted a home health care service and rented a hospital bed, a portable commode, an oxygen compressor, a wheelchair, and a walker. I selected a home health care doctor who I thought we could work with and he agreed to keep Mom on palliative care. I set up Mom’s physical and occupational therapy home visits and bought her a wardrobe of stretchy pajama pants because her clothes no longer fit due to her increasing congestive heart failure water weight. And we got the largest slippers we could find to cover her swollen feet.</p>
<p>Our spare room became Mom’s bedroom and we added a recliner for my husband to sleep on. He had agreed to continue keeping vigil by Mom’s bed at night so she wouldn’t fall out. I was beyond appreciative. I knew Mom’s health was extremely fragile and it seemed impossible that she could ever live independently again. Therefore, we had no idea what the future held.</p>
<p>All I knew was, for now, she was coming home with us.</p>
