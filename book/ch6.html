    <div class="chbody">
        <p>It was two days after Mom’s eighty-seventh birthday and a frigid winter’s day. Her room was growing dark in the early dusk. The solitary light bulb in the ceiling waited expectantly, but no one thought to turn it on because something extraordinarily important was happening in the bed before us. Mom lay on her back, eyes closed, breathing softly and rapidly and sleeping. She looked relaxed and peaceful, as if all the anxiety and fear of the recent weeks had drained from her face. It was a relief to see her like this. This was the mom I remembered. Even at her advanced age, she looked beautiful.</p>
<p>My older son sat at one side of her bed, his youthful frame silhouetted by the wintry scene outside the window. On a whim, he had brought his guitar and was playing it softly in the shadows. It was the perfect accompaniment to what was happening, giving Mom something sweet and gentle to focus on and conveying our unspoken permission if she wanted to go.</p>
<p>I sat at Mom’s other side, in the same lazy boy chair that had been my makeshift bed for the past two weeks. I held her hand and alternated between gazing at her face and staring out the window. I didn’t say anything. There was nothing to say. She had been through so much and it had been so hard to watch. We had been on this journey together and now all was well. She might be leaving us. Yet, it seemed so sweet somehow. She was comfortable—and so was I. It was a pivotal moment.</p>
<p>My main concern was not to disturb her. As if by some miracle, the nursing staff had failed to check on us for hours, so we had had this precious time to spend with Mom-time to reflect, time to love, time to appreciate.</p>
<p>Then, I made a huge mistake.</p>
<hr />
<p>A nurse aide came in and I casually mentioned to her what was happening. She immediately ran out and got the Physician’s Assistant (PA). The PA rushed in, took one look at Mom and with great concern declared that she wanted to do a chest x-ray and a urine sample. This was so surprising and out of synch with what we were witnessing, that I felt a wave of shock run through me. Why the sudden intrusion? Somehow, it didn’t seem right. This was lovely and peaceful. Mom did not appear to be in any pain. We were content to let her pass in peace. Why did we have to do all this? But the PA convinced me that the tests were just routine and that they wouldn’t disturb her. So I said OK, not knowing where this was headed.</p>
<p>The tests determined that Mom had pneumonia and a serious urinary tract infection. Evidently, these two maladies are quite common among elderly patients in skilled nursing facilities and often account for their short lifespan once they are admitted. The PA recommended sending her to the hospital. It was eight o’clock at night and I knew Mom didn’t want the whole hospital experience again. But I was not thinking clearly. I was physically and emotionally exhausted from our rollercoaster ride of the last three weeks. So I told the physician’s assistant I didn’t want any invasive procedures done (although I really had no idea what that meant at the time). She assured me that they would just give her antibiotics at the hospital and it wouldn’t cause her any pain. I felt pressured to make a decision, so I said, “If she was your mother, what would you do?”</p>
<p>“I would go to the hospital,” the PA retorted, “So that when she does die it will not be due to infection and she will be more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Looking back, I know now that that answer didn’t make any sense. Mom wasn’t in any pain and she seemed completely comfortable. It’s clear to me that the PA wanted Mom out of the facility to prevent her from dying under their watch because, unbeknownst to me, her DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order had not been signed by the attending physician. Unfortunately, I did not have the confidence as her health care proxy to deny any further intervention. If I’d had my wits about me, I would have demanded to talk with the doctor, whom I hadn’t seen in the two weeks that we’d been there. Supposedly, he had been sick with the flu the whole time, although it was during the Christmas holidays, so who knows? Anyway, there was no way he was coming in tonight, the PA said. So I didn’t insist. I gave in and said OK. She immediately gave Mom a shot in her buttocks and called for the ambulance.</p>
<p>EMTs wheeled Mom outside in the single digit weather and I jumped into the front seat of the ambulance. I thought we would be going, but the EMT told me that before we left she was going to start an IV.</p>
<p>I told her, “Her veins have been collapsing, she’s been stuck so much. I’d like you to wait.”</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>I sat in the ambulance for ten minutes while the back of the ambulance was wide open (and Mom lying there with pneumonia). The attendant finally slammed the door shut in frustration.</p>
<p>“Did you do it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No. They collapsed.”</p>
<p>STUPID.</p>
<p>As we rode to a different hospital this time, I thought about what had happened during Mom’s first hospital stay two weeks earlier. I could only hope that this experience would be better.</p>
<p>Could it be any <em>worse</em>?</p>
