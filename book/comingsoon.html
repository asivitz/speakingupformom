<h1 id="things-i-wish-id-known">Things I Wish I’d Known</h1>
<p>When Dr. Hanzelik speaks of someone responding to a medical emergency with an all-to-common “crisis orientation” rather than with preparation—that was certainly me. I hope it won’t be you.</p>
<p>As I look back on the five year period when I was Mom’s caregiver and health care proxy, there were several areas where I could have done better had I only known then what I know now. During that time, I desperately searched for advice. “What is going on with Mom? What should I do? Who can help?” I asked myself. I was truly begging for answers. Unfortunately, I found very few.</p>
<p>After Mom’s passing, I researched further until I found the answers to the questions above. They pointed the way to an understanding which I wish I had had when she was alive. However, my consolation is that now I can offer this understanding to you in another section entitled “Things I Wish I’d Known”.</p>
