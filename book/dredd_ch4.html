        <blockquote>
Why does our medical system often become a frightening prospect for the elderly?
</blockquote>
<p>It’s frightening for everybody. They have knives. They want to cut you. They have poisons that they want to feed you. They want to take you away from your family and lock you up in a room where nobody really cares about you. So it’s a dangerous environment and the more we can stay out of it the better. It could be much more friendly and cooperative and kind and understanding, but it does not seem to be moving in that direction. Right now, the big thing is technology and I don’t think technology is especially supportive of patient care and communication. So medicine keeps going through a transition, but not in the right direction in my opinion. I think the human aspect really needs a lot of development and it’s being ignored.</p>
<blockquote>
What is the primary care physician’s role when a patient enters the Emergency Room or a hospital?
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest, doctors are maxed out. If a patient or proxy wants their primary care doctor to follow up with them in the hospital, they need to keep after the physician. These days most hospitals use hospitalists, doctors who only take care of patients in the hospital. Admittedly, this is a setback for the patient because the patient loses the supervision of the doctor who knows them well. For my patients, I try to stay in touch at least by phone, guiding the patient and offering support.</p>
<p>Something to note though…Patients often choose to go to the Emergency Room when they have a medical problem rather than go to a private physician, but ER facilities can provide only limited care and are very expensive, often with overkill. ERs are called upon when it’s necessary to rapidly diagnose unusual, sudden conditions and quickly begin treating them. This tends to lead to lots of CT-type scans in order for physicians to cover all their bases. In <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em>, we read about someone who had been clearly traumatized by her previous medical interventions and began to depend on denial as a coping mechanism when she experienced new medical symptoms. What was needed was an open, friendly relationship with her primary care doctor. Unfortunately, she never found this in a doctor. In fact, she never wanted to see a doctor again! She even felt safer going to an Emergency Room when her facial lesion appeared, and the ER had very little to offer. This illustrates that the primary care physician should be the first “port of call,” and the patient needs to know that their doctor is on their side and he or she will do whatever it takes to help them get well. I’ll admit it’s challenging to locate a doctor who you can truly trust to guide you and protect you in the medical system. But these doctors do exist and are important to find.</p>
<blockquote>
Can the family doctor confer with the hospitalist (resident doctor) and discuss options for the patient?
</blockquote>
<p>The family physician can call the hospitalist, which I do quite frequently. When I hear one of my patients has been admitted, I generally try to speak to the patient in the Emergency Room. I let them know I’m available and that they can call me if they have any issues at the hospital. I also try to speak with the hospitalist and establish a communication. Unfortunately, the communication is not ideal. I have one hospitalist who texts me most days about how the patient is doing, so that works out the best. At least, I have a sense of what’s happening. Yet, it requires a lot of effort on the part of both of us. I have hospital records on line and I can go through the records and open them up and see what the patient’s lab results are, etc. But it takes a lot of time and doctors are busy people.</p>
<blockquote>
Can a family physician write orders when their patient is in the hospital, and perhaps override the hospitalist?
</blockquote>
<p>I know a hospitalist who routinely makes rounds from 1-3 a.m. So I wrote an order for one of my patients in his hospital that said: “Do not disturb this patient from 10 p.m to 7 am. Patient needs sleep. This includes doctor visits and vital signs.” It helped. But family physicians have been somewhat pushed out of hospitals in recent years. I was the primary doctor taking care of all my patients that were in the hospital until about two years ago. With hospitalists so prevalent, most family physicians are seeing patients in the hospital less and less, and allowing the hospitalists to provide the hospital care. You can’t have the family doctor and the hospitalist both seeing the patient because insurance won’t pay for both. So, for instance, I can choose if I want to take care of my own patient. However, if I don’t see patients in the hospital for a while, then the hospital tells me I can’t see patients there any more until I get approved because I’m “out of practice.” Basically, it’s a complicated situation. So, yes, the family physician can have influence in the patient’s care but in a lot of situations cannot write orders the way the hospitalist can.</p>
<blockquote>
What are your thoughts on those who are AMA (Against Medical Advice) patients?
</blockquote>
<p>This is a legal situation. It usually occurs in the Emergency Room or the hospital where the doctor is recommending something and the patient chooses to leave the situation. The doctor wants to make it clear that he is not telling the patient to leave, that the patient is leaving against his medical advice. So the doctor says they can leave, but they need to sign this recognition that they are choosing to leave against medical advice. Some patients refuse to do that, and they can’t be forced to do it. It’s basically the doctor protecting himself and saying, “I told the patient they should stay, but they insisted on leaving and what happens afterward isn’t my fault.”</p>
<blockquote>
And if something does happen, can the person who is AMA go back to the same facility or doctor?
</blockquote>
<p> Yes, they can usually go back. I’ve heard that sometimes insurance companies won’t pay for a person’s treatment if they go against medical advice, but I don’t really think that’s true. I believe it’s just a threatening tactic, trying to manipulate the patient. It’s the doctor who is trying to protect himself by saying, “Ok, you’re choosing to go out of the facility but make it clear that I’m not telling you to do that.” Doctors can be extremely intimidating, and a lot of doctors feel the patient shouldn’t say squeak. Do you realize that when a doctor writes down what a patient is to do it’s called the patient’s “orders”? It’s a military model—the doctor issues the orders and the nurses have to carry them out. So this whole consciousness about medical care needs to shift and it does so very slowly.</p>
