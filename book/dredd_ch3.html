        <blockquote>
What are the challenges for someone dealing with an elderly person who is undergoing the need for a change (downsize) in their lifestyle?
</blockquote>
<p>Downsizing is extremely difficult because elderly people are entrenched in their homes. Maybe they’ve been living in their house for forty years or so. It’s totally variable how long they’ve been living there but regardless, they are not very comfortable with changing. The changes are very difficult—particularly a change that involves totally disrupting their entire life and moving everything they own from one place to another. Then there’s the issue of moving to a new community where their friends are not there; the people they know are not there; all the comfortable things in their life are not there. It’s very disorienting. And if the person has a little bit of dementia, that adds to the situation and the person is going to seem more demented. I don’t think any of us are really prepared for getting old and dying.These are shocking aspects to our lives that we are not prepared for. We fight them, we resist them, we don’t believe in them. I feel the same way. The thought of moving my house is overwhelming to think about. All the stuff we’ve accumulated over the years! So the guided conversation really helps people start communicating about this and start developing the skills to handle those transitions.</p>
<p>As far as where to move, there are various alternatives. If the person has gotten to a point where they can’t really live by themselves, and they can be at the home of an adult child or relative, for example, depending on if it works for the family, I think that’s a very good possibility. We had that arrangement for my wife’s father and it was definitely nice for him and for us, too. But then it got to a point where it was too much for us to care for him, and he went to an assisted living facility where he lived for several months before he died. We were happy with the care he received and it seemed to work for him. So every situation is individual and finding the best solution can be very challenging. (In some localities, there are services available where the person’s job is to help people find living situations for their elderly parents. These people know all the local facilities and can help connect the caretakers with what is available.) So there are different levels of care to consider. Some people try and make it work at home and they have a caretaker come into the home on a regular basis. There are lots of different options and you just have to find what works for you. It’s never simple, but sometimes you connect with a really good person and that person becomes an incredible help—they do the bath and provide the food and clean the diapers. It really makes it much easier to have the loved one at home. The problem with that arrangement is it’s pretty expensive and it’s not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>In the story of <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em>, it was clear the mother was developing dementia a few years before she died, and after her hospitalizations that was a major aspect of what was going on with her. Her brain was not functioning as well as it used to, and it was to the point where she couldn’t live by herself. It’s extremely difficult to work with a person who has dementia, because you are used to the person being there. When their brain is not working, it’s like they’re not there and you can’t really share things with them. I’ve seen many families deal with this situation in many different ways. Sometimes, the caregiver just can’t manage the loved one at home. People are working, they have children at home, and they can’t provide the services that are needed. Taking care of an elderly person who has loss of brain function is extremely difficult, and sometimes it does require finding a type of facility. Some people are able manage at home. Certainly, people prefer to die at home, that’s their preference. However, often it doesn’t happen unless the family really prepares for it.</p>
<p>In the story of <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em>, If I had been the mother’s doctor at that time, I would have taken the opportunity to communicate with her and her adult daughter, to understand what was going on, to share the options that I saw, to put her daughter in touch with resources that could be helpful. What did happen developed over a couple of years time, it wasn’t just in the last three months of the mother’s life. A lot of things could have gone differently if the family had had the support they needed and could have thought through their decisions more carefully and rather than constantly guessing what was the right thing to do.</p>
