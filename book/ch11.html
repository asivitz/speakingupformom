    <div class="chbody">
        <p>Following that alarming phone call from the nursing home, my husband and I quickly got dressed and rushed to the hospital. At that point, it had been five years since Mom’s visit to the Emergency Room in Florida for her skin cancer; it had been three months since her sudden admittance to the Emergency Room in Ohio for her heart attack; and it had been exactly ten hours since we had left her at this latest rehab facility after her hip surgery.</p>
<p>I ran into the hospital emergency room yelling, “Do Not Resuscitate! Do Not Resuscitate!” but of course, it was too late. Mom had been found dead at the scene on the floor of the rehab facility, and the Emergency Medical Technicians had done cardiopulmonary resuscitation anyway. (The “Do Not Resuscitate” order I had signed was never seen or signed by the attending doctor, so the Emergency Medical Technicians did not honor it.) We were led into a hospital room where Mom was lying on a gurney, an intubation tube sticking out of her mouth and an IV port still in her arm. Luckily, I think she had been dead for hours before they found her and did those awful things. But I was in shock. Why had she ended up like this? In those final hours, was she frightened? Or was she brave and determined to finally decide her own fate? I’ll never know, of course, but I prefer to imagine the latter.</p>
<p>I asked my husband to take his penknife and snip off a lock of Mom’s hair, which I put in my pocket. Then I told the doctor we would stay and keep vigil until she went to the funeral home. The doctor encouraged us to go home and get some rest. It would be a while, he said.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I called the funeral home and was told they didn’t have her. So I called the hospital. “Do you have her?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” they said.</p>
<p>“Where is she?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know,” they said.</p>
<p>“You don’t know?!” I said incredulously. “Well, who does?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, you need to call the funeral home,” came the answer, and they hung up.</p>
<p>So I called the funeral home again.</p>
<p>“This has never happened before,” they said</p>
<p>“Well, find her!” I said, on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Three days later, they found Mom at the Sheriff’s Department. She was having an autopsy.</p>
<p>“What?” I screamed. “WHY are they doing an autopsy?” Evidently, in Ohio if it’s been less than three weeks since someone has had surgery and then they die, an autopsy is required. Thank you very much, malpractice insurance.</p>
<p>When we finally got her, Mom’s remains were cremated as she had wished, and the funeral home mailed her ashes to Florida via the U.S. Post Office so our family could fly down and inter her next to Dad. (Since 9/11, if you carry cremation ashes onto an airplane they need to have a special clearance and to go through an airport security scanner, so I opted for what I thought was an easier route.) A few days before we were scheduled to leave, I called the cemetery in Florida to make sure Mom’s ashes had arrived.</p>
<p>“Do you have them?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” they said. It had been over a week.</p>
<p>I called the funeral home. “Did you send the ashes?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” they said. “Last week.”</p>
<p>“Well, the cemetery doesn’t have them.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know what happened. We sent them,” they replied.</p>
<p>“Then find them!” I said, feeling more than a little frantic.</p>
<p>Two days later, the funeral home called back.</p>
<p>“The post office can’t find them. They’re putting a trace on it.” Are you kidding me??? First of all, shouldn’t a person’s ashes be sent by registered mail? And how ironic is it that Mom worked all those years for the U.S. Postal Service, and now they had managed to lose her!</p>
<p>Luckily, the ashes were eventually located in another Florida city and forwarded just in time for her burial. For the interment,I brought along a white vase that had been sitting under the TV in Mom’s apartment. After we arrived at the cemetery, the manager escorted me into his office and left me alone to place the ashes in the vase. On top of his desk sat a small, purple felt bag tied at the top with a skinny gold rope. Inside this bag was a clear plastic bag that contained Mom’s ashes.</p>
<p>I sat down in the desk chair and took a deep breath. Then I pulled out the plastic bag and tried to lower it into the vase. The bag was bigger than I expected and the vase opening was too small. After grunting and pushing, I finally stood up and untied the bag and tried to squish it in. Some of the ashes escaped and squirted up into the air in a dark gray plume, which then rained ashes all over the desk. Horrified, I ran out to the mausoleum and got my husband to come back and help me. Together we pried and squeezed the plastic bag into the vase until the contents fit inside. Then he left, and I was alone with Mom once more.</p>
<p>I sank back down into the desk chair and closed my eyes. Mom’s final journey, our five year odyssey together, was finally over. Every fiber in my being wanted to just sit there and rest, but there was still one more thing to do. With a sigh, I stood up and reverently picked up the vase. I then wet my fingers and blotted up all the fallen ashes that I could find—and rubbed them into my hair. I certainly wasn’t going to leave Mom there all by herself.</p>
<p>Then I walked out and shut the door.</p>
