    <div class="chbody">
        <p>Six months after Mom’s passing, most of her affairs had been taken care of. Her possessions were sorted and given away, or saved as keepsakes. A new resident moved into her apartment and immediately began redecorating. And the condominium association planted a red rose bush in Mom’s honor, right below her balcony (red roses were her favorite flower). I trim it every Spring and it’s doing great.</p>
<p>Of course, since then there’s been plenty to think about, and plenty of time to think. I feel a sense of relief that I no longer need to worry about her. And I’m experiencing a new found freedom, I guess you could say, that I can finally schedule my day (and my life) without hesitation or fear of her suddenly changing my plans. Occasionally, I walk through a grocery store or stroll through a park and sadly remember the wonderful times we had, just Mom and me—some very, very sweet times.</p>
<p>I also reflect on her last three months and the way she left—the pain, the humiliation and the countless medical interventions. We tried our best to help her, but was it enough? During that crucial time, I often reacted as her daughter rather than responding as her advocate. And unfortunately, there is truth in the saying that “by not making a decision you are indeed making one.”</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, about a year after Mom died, my husband’s mother died also. She had cancer and was given a prognosis by her doctor of one month to live. I watched as her family rallied around her and celebrated her life before she passed. She was clear headed and dictated every last detail of her final days. Hospice came to her assisted living apartment, and on her last visit to her longtime doctor, she said, “We had a good run, didn’t we?” She died in her own bed, with no invasive medical interventions and two of her children by her side.</p>
<p>I believe Mom, too, ultimately left on her own terms. She was done with the suffering. In fact, she was done with everything. And perhaps some good did come from it all. Perhaps that good is coming to you in the form of <em>Speaking Up For Mom</em>. I hope that you and your loved one will be encouraged to delve into its topics further, and to make your decisions wisely—because knowledge is power.</p>
<p>During what seems like a long time ago, when I was in the midst of Mom’s care, I wrote a poem about her. I’m not sure if it does her justice, but it describes the mom that I knew:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>My Mom—</p>
<p>Naive, yet daring</p>
<p>Gentle and kind</p>
<p>Yet a darker side (stubborn)</p>
<p>Afraid of anger, eager for love</p>
<p>Looking in the wrong places</p>
<p>Finding the wrong love</p>
<p>Wanting peace</p>
<p>Looking in the wrong places</p>
<p>Trusting me (sometimes)</p>
<p>But not trusting life</p>
<p>Loving the sunset</p>
<p>Yet never seeing the sun rise</p>
<p>Reluctantly aging</p>
<p>But aging gracefully</p>
<p>A kid in grandma’s shoes</p>
<p>A reason to be alive</p>
<p>Not fear, but joy</p>
<p>For what was given</p>
<p>And hope that it was enough.</p>
