    <div class="chbody">
        <p>It had been a busy two years since Mom moved from Florida to Ohio to be with us. My husband and I spent much of that time putting her financial affairs in order (which were a mess); purchasing and decorating her apartment (she picked out every item, including custom drapes and a wall mural); getting a new set of doctors (who changed and strengthened all her medications…grrr); and integrating her into our extended family.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was forced to tolerate snowy winters again, which she hated, and to figure out how to walk to the condo mail room to get her mail and then how to make it back to her apartment, which was no small feat. And although she was cordial and friendly to her neighbors, she couldn’t remember any of their names (or faces either probably). In a lot of ways, taking on such a new situation at that time in her life was more of a challenge than I realized.</p>
<p>Another challenge was, as I’ve mentioned, that Mom was acutely afraid of doctors. So whenever she had a routine doctor’s appointment (which was very often now), I would wait until the morning of the appointment to tell her, so she wouldn’t lose sleep over it. However, one of those mornings will forever haunt me.</p>
<p>I called Mom to tell her about her appointment, and when she answered, I could tell something was terribly wrong. She tried to talk to me but it sounded like gibberish. “I’ll be right over,” I said, and hung up the phone in a panic. Was she having a stroke?</p>
<p>When I got to the condominium, Mom was in her bathrobe and still sitting by the phone. She said she felt weak and was having trouble breathing. I looked in her pill box and saw that she hadn’t taken her medications in three days, and the recent meals we had brought her were still sitting in the frig. So I gave her a set of her medications and a few crackers to eat. Then I called the doctor.</p>
<p>“Mom can’t come for her appointment today,” I told the office nurse. “Something’s wrong. What should I do?”</p>
<p>“Take her to the hospital emergency room,” was the perfunctory reply. What else could she say? After all, doctors no longer made house calls. My heart sank.</p>
<p>I managed to get Mom to the living room couch and we sat and stared through the glass doors of the balcony to the wintry scene outside. I told her the doctor wanted her to go to the hospital. She didn’t say a word. Nor did I. I had made up my mind that this was her decision.</p>
<p>After twenty minutes, she said, “We should go. I’m having trouble breathing.”</p>
<p>I said ok.</p>
<p>“You knew I should go, didn’t you?” she asked. I told her yes, but that I was waiting for her to say so. She thanked me! Regrettably, this was the last time she decided anything for herself until her final day.</p>
<p>I got Mom dressed as best I could, however, her feet were so swollen I couldn’t find any shoes that would fit. My husband arrived with a wheelchair from the downstairs lobby and we gingerly got her into it. I knew Mom would be mortified if we called an ambulance, so we decided to take her to the hospital in our car. We wheeled her out into the hallway and I reluctantly closed the apartment door behind us, not knowing if she would ever see it again.</p>
<p>When we got to the hospital, the doctor determined that Mom had had a mild heart attack and fluid was building up in her only lung due to congestive heart failure (I had no idea what CHF was or that it was an incurable and ultimately terminal condition). After a couple of hours of IV treatments, she felt better and sat up on the edge of the bed and announced that she was ready to go home. We told the doctor.</p>
<p>“She’s not going anywhere tonight,” he said. “We need to keep her for observation.” Mom insisted that she wasn’t staying. She said she felt fine and wanted to go home. I watched this scenario unfold, completely unaware of any part I had to play. Finally, the doctor turned to me and said, “While you decide, I’ll get her a room in the cardiac unit.” And he walked out.</p>
<p>Mom and I looked at each other. I told her, like I had in Florida, that maybe we should trust the doctor. In reality, I’d had so little experience with hospitals, I really didn’t know if we could just leave. When Mom had arrived at the hospital, she had signed something called a “Consent to Treatment” or “Patient Consent Form” that all patients sign. It says in effect, “I voluntarily consent to and authorize the administration and performance of all medical treatment and procedures that may be prescribed and deemed appropriate and necessary.” Further down in the document, there’s another statement that says, “I understand that I may revoke my consent at any time and that this decision is mine alone.” However, I didn’t read that far, or ask for a copy to read later. And no one at the hospital pointed out to me that refusal of treatment was a patient’s right.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening before Mom finally got settled into her hospital room. The IV was dripping in more medicine to keep the fluid out of her lung; and she was hooked up to a heart monitor whose irritating alarm would sound if she moved in a certain way. They also had a catheter in place so she couldn’t get up to go to the bathroom, which, due to the catheterization, she felt like she needed to do every five minutes. With all of these tubes from the various machines attached to her, the nurse told me it was VERY IMPORTANT that Mom not get out of bed. So I decided to stay in the room overnight and keep vigil. My husband went home, and I curled up on the couch to get some sleep.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Mom’s mental status, especially her short-term memory, had been declining for some time. At home, occasionally she would call me, upset that she had hidden her purse to “test herself” and couldn’t find it. Or we’d go grocery shopping and she’d buy the exact same groceries that were already stocked in her kitchen. She no longer wrote her own checks or balanced her checkbook. And her wall calendar was filled with Xs where she kept track of what day it was (thanks to the daily newspaper she had delivered).</p>
<p>So the first night in the hospital, it’s quite possible Mom didn’t even remember why she was there. This seemed evident by the fact that she tried to get out of bed twenty-four times that night (I counted) and each time, I coaxed her to lie back down and told her that everything was going to be ok. But she didn’t believe me. At one point, she even accused me of bringing her there to die and said this was all part of a “plan”. By morning, we were both exhausted. Such a night should have convinced me that her stay in the hospital was a bad idea. Yet, the doctors weren’t listening to her and wouldn’t discharge her. Why didn’t I listen to her pleading and just insist? I really don’t know. Perhaps I was, once again, scared of not doing the right thing, being accused of elder abuse or being frowned upon by the doctor. The choice seems obvious now, but it was a real quandary at the time.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, I suppose I was trying to do the best that I could with no real guidance. Although Mom and I had reconnected and become closer, there continued to be things we never talked about. Looking back, having a mother in her 80’s and not discussing certain details about her end of life care seems crazy, but that was our situation. Mom may have had earlier heart episodes similar to this one, but if so, I never knew it. She must have kept it to herself, and except for her frequent and often frustrating last minute cancellations of our plans, I thought everything was fine. So seeing her suddenly in this medical crisis, compounded by the revelation of her fragile mental state which she had artfully concealed (with my willing denial) until now, put me in a state of shock—and I didn’t have the bearings I needed to clearly navigate the situation.</p>
<p>So for the next five days, Mom never left her bed (although she tried countless times), and I never left the hospital and rarely left her side. I did my best to comfort her, but it didn’t help. The longer she stayed, the worse things got. She forgot how to walk, she became withdrawn and weak, she stopped eating and she hardly spoke. Having never heard of or seen someone with hospital delirium before, I mistakenly blamed Mom’s worsening state on her medical condition, rather than on the hospital stay itself. And her doctors did the same. Tragically, she was stuck on a three foot by seven foot island (her bed) with no sign of rescue in sight.</p>
<p>Slowly, the fluid in Mom’s body started to build up again and the doctors increased her treatments. One night, during another dangerous episode of shortness of breath, I asked the attending doctor about hospice, hoping to ease some of her pain and suffering. He thought it was appropriate to consider, and said he would schedule a consultation. I didn’t know what that would involve, who would be there or when. My main concern was why the decision couldn’t be made right then, while she was in this state. But I didn’t ask any of this.</p>
<p>The next day, my husband and my younger son were visiting Mom. As I tried to feed her some lunch, she suddenly started shouting that she wanted all this to end and she wanted me to do something about it. It seemed like she was trying to get someone else besides me to listen to her. Because Mom was declining so fast, I thought maybe she meant she wanted to dispense with all her medical treatments so she could die peacefully. I ran and got the doctor on call and brought her back to the room. I asked Mom to repeat to the doctor what she had told me. Mom started shouting to the doctor, “I want to live! I want to live!”</p>
<p>Looking back, it’s obvious now that Mom was saying, “Get me out of here! Get me out of here!” However, at that moment, I was totally confused. Was she still capable of making her own decisions? Or as her health care proxy, was I now the decision maker? I had brought along the Health Power of Attorney document and was on record at the hospital as her health care proxy if she needed it. If this was the time, what decisions was I supposed to be making? Medical decisions for her as I saw them or support to uphold her decisions about herself? If you had asked me then, I would have given a different answer than I would give now.</p>
<p>The doctor pulled me aside and said, “It’s all about her now. No issues between you and her—and no guilt.” I had no idea what she was talking about, but somehow I felt I was being blamed for something. Then the doctor said that it was premature to talk about hospice and she wouldn’t recommend it. (I found out later that it is not uncommon for doctors to wait until a patient has three months or less to live before they will recommend hospice. Mom died exactly three months after my conversation with this doctor.)</p>
<p>Shortly after Mom’s outburst, it was like a bubble popped in her brain. She started eating and talking again, and after seven days in the hospital the doctors decided to discharge her—and send her to rehab for therapy. This new development totally surprised me, as she was fairly functional before she arrived at the E.R. and she didn’t have any surgeries or falls in the hospital that would warrant physical therapy—so why did she need to go to rehab? Evidently, her seven-day hospital stay had been so traumatic it rendered her an invalid who now needed professional help to regain some of her functionality.</p>
<p>A hospital social worker was sent to our room to advise me. Unfortunately, she didn’t mention home therapy as an option. So I chose a nearby assisted living facility in a retirement community that I had previously considered for Mom, although I had never seen its rehab area. In fact, I had no clue what a rehab facility was or that this meant just Mom was just moving from one type of hospital setting (acute care) to another (sub-acute care).</p>
<p>On her last night in the hospital, the nurses tried to change Mom’s IV needle rather than switch her to oral medication. The nurse stuck Mom twelve times and then gave up because her veins were so brittle. Had the nurse then documented this, it could have prevented Mom from being stuck unnecessarily in the future. As it was, I was told simply that the doctor determined Mom could take her meds by mouth after all.</p>
<p>But we weren’t out of the woods yet. The next day, the rehab facility called and said that they wanted Mom’s catheter changed before she could be transferred. (Sometimes catheters are needed, but often they are implemented just for staff convenience.) Three nurses came in the room to do the deed and hold Mom down during the procedure. I was told to leave the room, but I could hear Mom screaming on the other side of the door. I had had enough. I went in and refused the procedure. To my surprise, they stopped.</p>
