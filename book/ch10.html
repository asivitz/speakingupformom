    <div class="chbody">
        <p>It had been just three weeks since my husband moved Mom back to her apartment. Now she had fallen—and when she and I awoke on the floor of her bedroom, it was 4 a.m. Even though she was in a lot of pain, we somehow got her into her wheelchair and called 911. Then the Emergency Medical Technicians arrived and checked her over. At first they thought she might be ok—but eventually they decided to take her to a hospital in their ambulance.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the hospital, the orthopedic surgeon confirmed that Mom had broken her hip and he recommended surgery right away. My first response was “No.” I had told myself many times that I would never put her through the hospital experience again. I had to stand my ground.</p>
<p>However, the surgeon’s justifications sounded compelling. He explained that without the surgery she would never walk again, she might be in a lot of pain for the rest of her life, and she couldn’t live as long with a broken hip. I called Mom’s home health care physician’s assistant and told him I didn’t want to put Mom through the surgery. He concurred with the hospital that she should have the operation. I hung up, knowing the surgeon was waiting for my decision. It felt like I didn’t have much time to think.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I should have demanded a hospice consultation right then and there. Here was a eighty-seven year old woman with one lung, on continuous oxygen and suffering from a worsening chronic and incurable illness (congestive heart failure), prone to infections and living with debilitating dementia and delirium. She had had four hospital and/or rehab stays in the last twelve weeks. She had no short-term memory and, at best, she was bound to a walker before she fell, plus she required constant supervision because she remained a serious fall risk. And with this proposed surgery, she was facing a protracted stint in a rehabilitation facility, which she had already demonstrated she was incapable of completing successfully.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the outcome of the hospice consultation would have been, but perhaps there was a chance that a voice of sanity from the medical community would have backed me up and said, “Let her live out her days in peace.” As it was, there was no such voice. Even Mom’s primary care physician, who had been our family doctor for over twenty-five years, never once called me to follow up on her situation after my frantic phone call to his office three months earlier. I had travelled this medical nightmare without a doctor’s support, and now the hospitalist was pushing for a decision. Unfortunately, trusting the hospitalist’s advice rather than my gut instinct had become my default in Mom’s journey. So I said to go ahead.</p>
<p>I held Mom’s hand as they took her into the surgery prep area, then I was told to leave. As I left her side, she started yelling for me. She was so scared. I saw them put an oxygen mask on her face as she struggled to talk. She had no idea what was going on. It was awful. When I finally got to see her in the Recovery Room, she was lying there unconscious, with an intubation tube stuck down her throat and a ventilator machine making her breathe—all routine procedures, I was told, when someone requires general anesthesia during surgery. I must admit that the nurse who told me this didn’t sound very convincing.</p>
<p>After her operation, Mom was kept in the Intensive Care Unit for two days. We didn’t stay with her because she was supposedly being watched constantly by the nursing staff. However, I discovered that the nurses were giving her sleeping pills because they claimed that she was “restless.” Basically, they were drugging her. And when Mom took one of those pills, she was knocked out and groggy for most of the following day. It was really weird to see her like that.</p>
<p>When she was finally moved to the Orthopedic Surgery ward, my husband began staying with her at night again and I stayed with her during the day because I just couldn’t do the night shift anymore. Like the previous times, she was catheterized (hooked up to a urine bag so she couldn’t go pee or feel when she needed to) and she continued to get intravenous medications. And of course, there was an air compressor cycling on and off constantly to supply her with twenty-four hour oxygen. She also had inflatable cuffs on her legs to keep her blood from clotting and she was told not to put any weight on her left hip.</p>
<p>Then, there was the one thing that Mom hated most. She wasn’t allowed to get out of bed, and she kept trying to do so. To address this situation at night, the nurse wanted to give her another sleeping pill. We explained how groggy Mom seemed the next day after taking those. So the nurse gave her half of a pill instead. That was almost as bad. My husband said Mom woke up in the middle of the night, totally disoriented and terrified.</p>
<p>It was during her second evening in the Orthopedic Surgery ward that Mom confided in my husband that she felt really blue, and then she began to cry. My husband called me and begged me to come to the hospital. I was totally burnt out and I told him I couldn’t—but he sounded so desperate, I decided to go anyway. When I got to the hospital, Mom was sitting on the edge of her bed, looking very distraught. She said she felt like something really bad was going to happen to her and she couldn’t shake it. Did I know what it was? I said no, I didn’t. She said my eyes looked sad.</p>
<p>And then she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you speak up, they think you’re a problem.</p>
<p>If you laugh, they think you’re silly.</p>
<p>If you keep quiet, they think you’re an imbecile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This profound observation almost startled me. It made me realize what little quality of life Mom now had. She kept saying over and over, “What are we doing here? Why are we here? [And five minutes later] What are we waiting for?” She had no recollection of her hip surgery. She didn’t know why she was commanded to stay in bed. She not only didn’t know where she was, she didn’t know who she was, and she kept checking the hospital ID band on her wrist as if it was the only reference to her identity.</p>
<p>As I looked at Mom, I thought of that fateful night at the rehab facility when she almost passed away from pneumonia. I remembered my conversation with the physician’s assistant and declaring to her that I didn’t want any further invasive treatments. I remembered asking the physician’s assistant what she would do if this were her mother. And I remembered her response, “If she were my mother, I would send her to the hospital so that when she does die, it will not be due to infection and she will be more comfortable.” Was this her idea of “more comfortable”?</p>
<p>The next day, Mom said something with such finality that it almost took my breath away. Looking back, I realized that there were many times during her two years in Ohio when she and I would make plans and then, at the last moment, she’d cancel them. At the time, I didn’t know why this was happening and I found it a bit irritating. However, now, I understood that she must have had days when she didn’t feel well or she felt like something bad might happen to her. Yet, she hid her medical symptoms from me because she didn’t want to pursue them. So on this day, after all she had been through, she said to me, or actually she didn’t really even say it to me—she just said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew this was going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was as if all those times of denial, which had helped her cope with life’s difficulties in the past, had finally run out. There she was, a human being who didn’t know what was going on or where she was, and yet had an overwhelming sense of impending doom. She was finally up against a wall that couldn’t be ignored or wished away and she knew it. How tragic is that?</p>
<p>Five days after her surgery, the surgeon told us that we could once again move Mom to a rehab facility. My husband and I resolved not to go back to the same place as we had before, so I made an appointment with the hospital’s social worker to ask for suggestions. She said she wasn’t allowed to make any recommendations. And still no one talked to us about hospice.</p>
<p>I knew of another assisted living facility that had a rehab unit. I sent my husband to look at it and he said that it looked nice. There was a semi-private room available right across from the nurses’ station, which was important so someone could keep an eye on Mom. And there was already a patient in the room, so Mom would have some company. I checked with the social worker and she said the place was new and there were no complaints thus far. So we decided to move Mom there.</p>
<p>Before the hospital could transport her, however, the rehab facility required that Mom have a bowel movement. So the nurse gave her a stool softener. When that didn’t work, she gave her an extra dose. I was completely unfamiliar with stool softeners, having never used one myself. All I knew was that the nurse kept us waiting until evening, and when it still didn’t work, she sent for the ambulance anyway. For some reason, Mom was always being transported in the evening when her paranoia was at its worst. And tonight, she was more fearful than I had ever seen her. She begged me not to let her leave the hospital. She was really hysterical. I held her hand all the way to the ambulance and while they loaded her into the back of the van. Then I climbed into the front passenger seat.</p>
<p>The ambulance ride itself seemed to take forever. The cab was separate from the back of the ambulance this time, so I couldn’t see Mom and she couldn’t see me. And the driver was in a chatty mood and didn’t seem to be in a hurry to get to our destination. He took the long way to the rehab facility and we got stuck in rush-hour traffic, so by the time we got to the facility it was after 6 p.m. Mom was beyond freaked and her blood pressure was 160/110. On top of this, there was no oxygen compressor set up in her room and the ambulance driver took his oxygen tanks with him. So we waited nearly twenty minutes for Mom’s oxygen set up to arrive, and while we were waiting, her oxygen saturation dropped to 72 percent, which was dangerously low.</p>
<p>The rehab facility also wouldn’t give Mom a bedside commode, although she was fresh from hip surgery, because the physical therapist who needed to evaluate her had already gone for the day. Supposedly, Mom would be evaluated first thing in the morning. In the meantime she would need to be carried to the bathroom by a male nurse. Why I didn’t raise holy hell about this, I’ll never know.</p>
<p>As if on cue, the stool softener finally started to work, so the male nurse carried Mom into the bathroom and set her on the commode. I went in with her. It was so embarrassing for her. She had a sort of diarrhea episode and because she had been carried, her hip was now killing her. She told me, “I’ve never experienced such pain.” Then she said, “Llee, I don’t think I’m going to make it.” What could I say? I told her that we’d have to do the best that we could. She said ok.</p>
<p>The nurse brought in all the legal forms and I signed them, including the “Do Not Resuscitate” order. Learning from my past experience, I asked when that form would be signed by the doctor and was assured that it would be signed within 24 hours. Mom was put back in bed and they brought her her dinner. She ate a few bites and was pleasant but quiet. I asked if she liked her room. She said yes. I asked if she was in pain. She said no. I noticed “Wheel of Fortune” was on the TV but she wasn’t watching it.</p>
<p>Then I did something that I truly regret. I got a phone call from a friend and I took it in Mom’s room. The friend asked me how Mom was doing and I said, “We think she is doing OK, but she’s just had hip surgery and she’s gaining all this water weight again and blowing up like a balloon.” Here I was, talking about her as if she wasn’t there—and I didn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the patient who was supposed to share Mom’s room had been transferred. And we didn’t see anyone at the nurses’ station the whole time we were there. So my husband and I went out into the hallway and I told him I thought I should stay with Mom, that she shouldn’t be left alone. He said that if we stayed, it would start a pattern that we couldn’t reverse and we’d be there every night again. I agreed. We were both exhausted and had reached our limit.</p>
<p>I told the nurse that we were thinking of leaving, but I was concerned that Mom might try to get out of bed. He said he would give her a sleeping pill. I explained that if he did, she would be too groggy to do any physical therapy in the morning. So he said he would write on her chart to give her half of a pill. I told him I didn’t think that would work either because she would wake up in the middle of the night and try to get out of bed. He said not to worry, he would check on her.</p>
<p>So we went back to Mom’s room and I told Mom we were leaving. She said OK and surprisingly didn’t protest. We kissed her goodbye, promised to see her in the morning and walked out. As we drove home, my husband and I talked about how guiltless she made us feel for leaving her. It was the first time in over three months that one of us had not been with her.</p>
<p>About 6:30 the next morning, we got a phone call. The nurse at the rehab facility said, “Something has happened to your Mom and they are taking her to the hospital. You need to go there right away.”</p>
