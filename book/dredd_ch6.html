        <h1>The Doctor on the Role of Advance Directives and the Health Care Proxy</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="chbody">
        <blockquote>
Do Advance Directives really work? If only certain ones, which? Living Will, POLST, DNR?
</blockquote>
<p>Advance directives are legal documents that are usually drawn up by a lawyer. I see them as very valuable documents to help a person express their understanding that things do happen and they want to be prepared for them. In general, however, an advance directive doesn’t work unless someone from the family is there to push it, emphasize what’s in it and make it clear to the appropriate people who make those decisions. This is a major role on the part of the family or proxy—to make sure that the advance directive is carried out.</p>
<p>The Living Will is one of those legal documents that describes what the patient wants. It communicates who the proxies are that this person has designated and what kind of care is desired. So it’s a legal document but it’s not the same as medical orders. The only way to implement the Living Will is through actual medical orders.</p>
<p>I think the POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) works if it it’s available, and if it can be found when needed. The POLST is actual physician orders, and paramedics who come to your house or hospitalists at the hospital are tuned in to respect the POLST. However, it differs from advance directives in that the POLST originates from the patient’s physician. Basically, the doctor makes orders that say, “If this person has a cardiac arrest, I do not want you to do resuscitation on this patient.” It’s a medical order.</p>
<p>DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) also comes from the doctor and can be part of the POLST or exist by itself. For doctors in the hospital, that’s the main question that is asked, “Is this patient a DNR?” If the patient is a DNR, then that is labelled on their chart and written everywhere so that the medical staff knows not to call the cardiac team if the patient loses consciousness. In the hospital, if a patient has a cardiac arrest, as soon as the nurses spot it, they call the cardiac arrest team and that team (people who don’t know the patient at all but they do resuscitations) will run into the room and start pounding on the patient’s chest and putting a tube down the patient’s throat to help them breathe, and do everything they can to resuscitate the patient. If the patient’s chart is labeled DNR, however, and it’s part of the orders, then when the nurse sees that, she realizes this is a DNR and she won’t call that team. Typically in that situation, the nurse will first communicate what’s on the chart to the doctor on call, who will then tell the nurse that the patient is a DNR.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand something about the DNR. When a hospitalist looks at a critical situation, frequently they don’t know the patient and don’t want to make a mistake and let someone die who shouldn’t be dying. So they always err on the side of doing everything they can, unless someone speaks up and says this is not what this person wants. It needs to be very clear in order for the doctor to let the person go. Otherwise, they feel that they are making a big mistake. So the healthcare proxy needs to speak up when the patient is admitted and say, “I’m this person’s proxy. Here’s a copy of the advance directive naming me. I’ll be the contact person for you, and this person does not want excessive care.” It’s an important dialog. Then the doctor will initiate the DNR so the hospitalists will know whether the patient is a DNR or not, because if they are a DNR, it makes things simpler for the doctor. However, if a critical situation is already in progress when the patient arrives at the hospital and the patient is arresting, only the POLST will slow things down at that point.</p>
<blockquote>
What is the role of the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care or health care proxy, in your opinion?
</blockquote>
<p>The health care agent or proxy is an important bridge between the patient and the health care system. Their main role is to understand what the patient wants and to help them get it. Admittedly, this can be very challenging. The proxy needs to know how to listen and also how to speak up. They need to encourage the patient to talk about their perspective: what do they want from their care? What are their fears? What are their hopes? What are they feeling in their body? Also, it’s best if the advocate does their homework, using reliable sites on the Internet like Medscape or the Mayo Clinic, to gain a good understanding of the patient’s conditions, so that they are prepared to discuss the patient with the patient’s doctors. Amazing recoveries are possible if the patient is motivated to get well, the proxy understands his or her role and the doctor is committed to helping the patient recover.</p>
<blockquote>
What do you feel is the most important factor in choosing a health care proxy?
</blockquote>
<p>Choosing a health care proxy has a lot to do with the end-of-life planning conversation. This is something that really applies to all of us. We may not like it, but we don’t automatically live to age ninety and then die. People die as children, as teenagers, in their 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. So serious illness and death can occur at any point in life. The guided conversation is really a relevant way of saying that if I were to become really sick what do I want? And in that conversation you have to say, for example, if my brain was not functioning or I lost a lot of brain function or if I was incurable and was not going to come back, do I want my life prolonged as much as possible? Or do I want care, but there are certain things I don’t want? Or do I just want comfort care?</p>
<p>So the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care is a legal document where you describe the type of care you want and you name the people who you trust to make health care decisions for you, if for any reason you are not capable of making those decisions yourself. So it needs to be more than a piece of paper. The person you choose needs to connect with you and be sure that they understand your approach to life, the kind of decisions you want made. For this person’s role is not to be the original decision maker. Their role is really to implement what your choices would be in those circumstances. So you need to choose a person that you feel confident in and that you can have that open conversation with and who can communicate for you.</p>
<blockquote>
When, if ever, is it no longer up to the patient to decide their fate in the health care system, but instead is up to the health care proxy?
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the patient’s ability to make decisions. If they have the ability to think through a decision and ask appropriate questions and say, “Yes, I want to do this,”or “I don’t want to do this,” then it’s their decision. But if they are unconscious, demented, unable to talk, or an emotional wreck or hysterical, then the doctors don’t have someone they can work with to make meaningful decisions. Then it goes to whomever they have delegated for that role, if they have delegated someone. If they have not, then it goes to whomever seems to be the closet person in their family whose is functioning in that role.</p>
<p>As far as when to activate the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, frequently it just develops. What happens sometimes is that the person has a large family and all the different family members start asking the doctor questions at different times. So the doctor says, “I can only talk to one family member.” It becomes necessary to delegate someone who will be the contact person for that doctor and communicate to the rest of the family whats happening. As we spoke about, frequently people bring in their Health Care Power of Attorney and show that their name is listed, and if so, that will be respected. Their name will be noted on the patient’s chart. But if there is no proxy listed, then the doctor will talk to the most prominent person—usually the spouse or an adult child.</p>
<p>As was mentioned in Speaking Up For Mom, sometimes doctors talk to the proxy about the patient as if the patient wasn’t in the room. They do this when they feel the person really doesn’t get what is going on, and it does happen that these conversations may not be very sensitive to the patient. Personally, I believe the patient has much more understanding of the conversation than they realize.</p>
<blockquote>
Are there resources available, in your opinion, about how to be an effective health care proxy?
</blockquote>
<p>First, there’s the relationship that you have with your or your loved one’s primary care doctor. In the story of Speaking Up For Mom, it sounds like this help really wasn’t available during her mother’s hospitalizations. However, when you do have that relationship, a primary care doctor will take the time to hear what your issues are, help you understand your options, and guide you so that you can make better choices and be more comfortable with the process. Otherwise, the process can seem to be constantly galloping ahead of you and you are always trying to play catch up. The best idea is to do your homework before these important decisions need to take place. I think there are more and more resources that are coming online and developing, but you have to dig a little bit to find them. And it’s important to find legitimate resources from people who have had experience and know what they are talking about.</p>
